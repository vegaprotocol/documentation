Vega is a protocol for creating and trading derivatives on dated future and perpetual markets, on a fully decentralised network.

The Vega mainnet is run by a set of validator nodes. There's also a Vega testnet called Fairground, where it's possible to try trading cash-settled futures and perpetuals on a test network.

Learn more about Vega below.
