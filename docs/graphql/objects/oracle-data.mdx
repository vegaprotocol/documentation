An oracle data contains the data sent by an oracle

```graphql
type OracleData {
  pubKeys: [String!]
  data: [Property!]
  matchedSpecIds: [String!]
  broadcastAt: String!
}
```


### Fields

#### `pubKeys` ([`String`](/docs/testnet/graphql/scalars/string))

pubKeys is the list of public keys that signed the data


#### `data` ([`Property`](/docs/testnet/graphql/objects/property))

data contains all the properties send by an oracle


#### `matchedSpecIds` ([`String`](/docs/testnet/graphql/scalars/string))

lists all the oracle specs that matched this oracle data.
When the array is empty, it means no oracle spec matched this oracle data.


#### `broadcastAt` ([`String`](/docs/testnet/graphql/scalars/string))

RFC3339Nano formatted date and time for when the data was broadcast to the markets
with a matching oracle spec.
It has no value when the oracle date did not match any oracle spec.
