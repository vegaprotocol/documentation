An individual trader at any point in time is considered net long or net short. This refers to their Open Volume,
calculated using FIFO. This volume is signed as either negative for LONG positions and positive for SHORT positions. A
single trade may end up "splitting" with some of its volume matched into closed volume and some of its volume
remaining as open volume. This is why we don't refer to positions being comprised of trades, rather of volume.
