Valid order statuses, these determine several states for an order that cannot be expressed with other fields in Order.

```graphql
enum OrderStatus {
  STATUS_ACTIVE
  STATUS_EXPIRED
  STATUS_CANCELLED
  STATUS_STOPPED
  STATUS_FILLED
  STATUS_REJECTED
  STATUS_PARTIALLY_FILLED
  STATUS_PARKED
}
```


### Values

#### [`STATUS_ACTIVE`](#)

The order is active and not cancelled or expired, it could be unfilled, partially filled or fully filled.
Active does not necessarily mean it's still on the order book.


#### [`STATUS_EXPIRED`](#)

This order trades any amount and as much as possible and remains on the book until it either trades completely or expires.


#### [`STATUS_CANCELLED`](#)

The order is cancelled, the order could be partially filled or unfilled before it was cancelled. It is not possible to cancel an order with 0 remaining.


#### [`STATUS_STOPPED`](#)

This order was of type IOC or FOK and could not be processed by the matching engine due to lack of liquidity.


#### [`STATUS_FILLED`](#)

This order is fully filled with remaining equalling zero.


#### [`STATUS_REJECTED`](#)

This order was rejected while being processed.


#### [`STATUS_PARTIALLY_FILLED`](#)

This order was partially filled.


#### [`STATUS_PARKED`](#)

This order has been removed from the order book because the market is in auction, the reference price doesn't exist, or the order needs to be repriced and can't. Applies to pegged orders only
