Metamask Snaps are a new way to extend Metamask to support new functionality and protocols. With the Vega Snap, you can now use MetaMask to participate in Vega markets & governance.

## Installation
Open the 'Connect' dialog in Vega Console. If you have a version of Metamask that supports snaps, you'll see a button labelled 'Install Vega MetaMask Snap' which will handle configuring MetaMask to support Vega Protocol.

## Alternatives
Our [browser extension](./index.md#vega-wallet-browser-extension) is also available for Firefox and Chrome. For a full list of alternatives, check out [Vega Wallets](./index.md).

## Source
The source code [is available on our GitHub page](https://github.com/vegaprotocol/vega-snap).
