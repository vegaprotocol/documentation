A Vega Wallet apps allow you to manage wallets and key pairs, deposit and withdraw assets, stake and sign transactions.

You can interact with a Vega wallet and its keys through a browser extension, two different apps, or integrate using the API.

## Browser extension
The Vega Wallet browser extension is an early stage implementation of the Vega Wallet, available for Chrome and Firefox. The extensions linked are only for use with the Fairground network.

**[Chrome extension ↗](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/vega-wallet-fairground/nmmjkiafpmphlikhefgjbblebfgclikn)**

**[Firefox extension ↗](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-GB/firefox/addon/vega-wallet-beta/)**

The browser extension lets you connect to a Vega Wallet right in your browser, rather than having to install a separate app. It allows you to:
* Create a new wallet and public keys
* Import an existing wallet and its keys
* Connect to Vega dApps, such as Console and the governance dApp
* Approve or reject transactions

## CLI app
Use the **[command line app](./cli-wallet/index.md)** to do everything you can do with the desktop app, plus:
* Customise key details 
* Isolate keys
* Build and send transactions

## Wallet API
Integrate with the [Vega Wallet API](../category/api/wallet-api) to build UIs or create other headless applications like bots or scripts.
