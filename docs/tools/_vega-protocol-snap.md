A snap lets you use your existing MetaMask account to quickly set up a Vega keypair for trading, staking tokens, and sending other transactions. No Vega Wallet software required.

The Vega snap is only available for mainnet right now. To learn more about it, switch to the mainnet version in this site's top navigation bar, or [click through to the mainnet snap page](https://docs.vega.xyz/release/tools/vega-protocol-snap).
