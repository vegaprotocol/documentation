Vega provides several apps and tools to make it easier to interact with the protocol. 

For restricted mainnet, those tools include:
### Vega Wallet
Use **[Vega Wallet](./vega-wallet/index.md)** to connect to a network to associate tokens for staking, and to sign messages. Using the Vega Wallet ensures your keys will be completely disassociated from your personal identity, and Vega will have no way to connect them with you, unless you share your public key for any reason.

There are two apps available to interact with a Vega Wallet, the **[CLI wallet app](./vega-wallet/cli-wallet/index.md)**, and the **[desktop wallet app](./vega-wallet/desktop-app/index.md)**. 

### $VEGA Token website
Use **[$VEGA Token website](https://token.vega.xyz)** to stake your tokens to nominate the validators that run the network, participate in network goveranance, and earn and claim rewards.

### Vega Capsule
Use **[Vega Capsule](https://github.com/vegaprotocol/vegacapsule)** to create an instance of the Vega network on your computer to experiment with using the protocol. 

[Set up Vega Capsule](https://github.com/vegaprotocol/vegacapsule#vegacapsule): The Vega Capsule `readme` file in the repo provides information on the prerequisites you need, and details on how to set up Capsule. 

* Become familiar with Vega, and run commands and API scripts in a controlled environment
* Try out liquidity strategies locally before using the public testnet
* Practice with the market creation process, to make sure proposals will be accepted for a vote
* Simulate network conditions ahead of putting forward a network configuration change proposal
* Simulate market conditions or price scenarios without being concerned about unexpected user behaviour

### Vega Tools repo
The **[Vega Tools repo](https://github.com/vegaprotocol/vegatools)** provides a set of utilities for inspecting and interacting with a Vega network through the APIs.
