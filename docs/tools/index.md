## Vega Wallet
Use **[Vega Wallet](./vega-wallet/index.md)** to connect to a network to trade, associate tokens for staking, and sign messages. Using the Vega Wallet ensures your keys will be completely disassociated from your personal identity, and Vega will have no way to connect them with you, unless you share your public key for any reason.

There are several ways to interact with a Vega Wallet: 
* **[Browser extension (Alpha version)](./vega-wallet/index.md#vega-wallet-browser-extension)**
* **[CLI wallet app](./vega-wallet/cli-wallet/index.md)**
* **[Desktop wallet app](./vega-wallet/desktop-app/index.md)**

## Trading interface
Use **[Vega Console](https://console.fairground.wtf)** to try trading on a testnet trading interface. The Fairground network is set up to provide a fairly realistic experience where you can place orders, provide liquidity, and see how the market mechanics work.

* **[Charts on Console](./tools/vega-console/charts)**
* **[Host Console on IPFS](./tools/vega-console/host-console-on-ipfs)**

## Governance dApp
Use the **[Vega Governance dApp](https://governance.vega.xyz)** to stake your tokens to nominate the validators that run the network, participate in network goveranance, and earn and claim rewards.

## Block explorer
The block explorer allows you to query transactions, network parameters, available assets (and their IDs) and more.

* **[Block explorer for mainnet](https://explorer.vega.xyz/)**
* **[Block explorer for fairground](https://explorer.fairground.wtf/)**

## Vega Tools repo
The **[Vega Tools repo](https://github.com/vegaprotocol/vegatools)** provides a set of utilities for inspecting and interacting with a Vega network through the APIs.
