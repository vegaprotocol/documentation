We're currently building out samples and how-tos for popular programming languages. This is a work-in-progress, and not all the functionality that we plan to support is available. However, we would like your feedback on what you think of it so far. Share your feedback on the [community forum](https://community.vega.xyz/c/testnet/12) or [Discord](https://discord.gg/bkAF3Tu). The [Using Vega's APIs](../apis/">}}) section has reference information and connection details for the current **Vega APIs** (node and wallet).

:::info
To get started see the list of guides below.

Alternatively, head over to the [API Sample Scripts](https://github.com/vegaprotocol/sample-api-scripts/) repo on [GitHub](https://github.com/vegaprotocol) to see full examples of the how-to code.
