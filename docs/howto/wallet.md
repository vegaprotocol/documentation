# How to use Vega Wallet APIs

:::danger Broken links
* Wallet API reference
:::

## Introduction

To submit orders and other commands on Vega, users need to sign transactions with a private and public key pair. Users on Vega are pseudonymous and are referenced by their public keys. To assist with API integration there is a **REST API service** served from the Vega Wallet software providing signing and key management. 

:::info
For more detail on how keys or signing work on a Vega network, see the section on [Wallets and Signing](../../vega-wallet/signing).
:::

The Vega Wallet software can store many wallets, and each wallet can store many key pairs. 

Common actions for a wallet include; **logging in**, **retrieving a key pair** and **signing transactions** (such as an order submission). There are several useful how-to guides below that will help with management of keys and signing.


## Logging in to an existing wallet

Connect to a Vega Wallet server and log in. This can be either a hosted wallet, one you run yourself locally or stored in the cloud. The resulting `token` will be used to authenticate with the wallet for other actions (such as signing):

## Creating a new wallet

Connect to a wallet server to create a new wallet. As mentioned earlier, this can be either a hosted wallet, one you run yourself locally or stored in the cloud. Just like logging in, once a new wallet has been created, a `token` will be returned and it will be used to authenticate with the wallet for other actions (such as signing):

## Generating a new private and public key pair

Once authenticated with Vega Wallet, it is possible to generate one or more new key pairs (private and public keys) to sign transactions for the Vega network. For detailed information on key pairs, see the section on [Wallets and Signing](../wallets-and-deposits/wallet#what-is-a-key-pair). Note that the private key is *not* returned. Your public key will be used as your `party` identifier on Vega:

## Signing a transaction

Connect and call sign transaction on a Vega Wallet server. Note: it is possible to set the `propagate` field to `true`. This instructs the wallet to submit the signed transaction directly to the Vega node specified in its config file:
