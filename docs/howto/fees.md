## Introduction

This guide shows how to use the APIs to estimate fees for trading, as well as how to estimate the margin requirements for a potential order.

On Vega, fees are incurred on every trade and it is the price taker who pays the fee. Vega does not charge 'traditional' gas fees, and importantly the [fee structure](../trading-questions.md#what-are-the-fees-for-trading-on-the-vega-testnet-and-who-gets-the-fees">}}) **rewards the participants that make Vega possible**.

Additionally, Vegaâ€™s automated cross margining system means gains on one market can be released and used as margin on another. Estimating the margin requirements for a potential order is useful to minimise rejected orders because of insufficient margin or collateral.

## Where do I find the fees charged for a trade?

Any [fees charged](../trading-questions.md#how-are-trading-fees-calculated) on Vega are shown on [individual trades](list-orders-trades.md#listing-trades-for-an-order">}}) returned by the API. For example, on each trade there are the following fields:

| Field          |  Description  |
| :----------------- | :------------- |
| `buyerFee` | Any fees for the party on **buy** side of the trade, also known as the `buyer`. |
| `sellerFee` | Any fees for the party on **sell** side of the trade, also known as the `seller`. |

```
  "buyerFee": {                                  "sellerFee": {
     "infrastructureFee": "37963",                  "infrastructureFee": "0",
     "liquidityFee": "75926",                       "liquidityFee": "0",
     "makerFee": "18982"                            "makerFee": "0"
  }                                              }
```

:::info
**Fee values** are in the settlement currency with decimal precision (DP) for the market the trade occurred on.
:::

Contained inside each of the buyer and seller fee structures are the fees charged:

| Field          |  Description  |
| :----------------- | :------------- |
| `infrastructureFee` | Fees paid to validators as a reward for running the infrastructure of the network. |
| `liquidityFee` | Liquidity portion of the fee is paid to market makers for providing liquidity, and is transferred to the market-maker fee pool for the market. |
| `makerFee` | Maker portion of the fee is transferred to the non-aggressive, or passive party in the trade (the maker, as opposed to the taker). |

Fees are incurred on every trade on Vega, but it is the price taker who pays the fee. The price taker is the party that traded using a market order, or placed a limit order that traded immediately. See our explainer section on [Market and trading info](../trading-questions.md#what-are-the-fees-for-trading-on-the-vega-testnet-and-who-gets-the-fees">}}) to learn more on how fees are calculated, and who gets the fees.

The network has a set of default fee factors configured by the [network parameters](create-market.md#where-do-i-find-the-current-network-parameters); `market.fee.factors.infrastructureFee`, `market.fee.factors.liquidityFee` and `market.fee.factors.makerFee`. 

These can also be overridden on a per market basis. It is recommended to check the [market configuration](markets.md#listing-markets-on-a-vega-network) or [network parameters](create-market.md#where-do-i-find-the-current-network-parameters) when performing any fee calculation.

## How do I estimate the fees for an order?

Connect to a Vega API server and *estimate fees for an order on a Vega market*:

Connect to a Vega API server and *estimate the margin* for an order on a Vega market:

If successful, the response will include:

| :----------------- | :------------- |
| `marginLevels` | The estimated margin for the proposed order. This includes **initial**, **search**, **release** and **maintenance** levels. The margin levels should be adjusted for the number of decimal places on the target market, for example, 5 decimal places.

In a similar way to fees calculation, the network has a set of default margin scaling factors configured by the [network parameters](create-market.md#where-do-i-find-the-current-network-parameters) in `market.margin.scalingFactors`, for example:

```
# market.margin.scalingFactors
{
  "searchLevel": 1.025,
  "initialMargin": 1.05,
  "collateralRelease": 1.1
}
```

Again, these can also be overridden on a per market basis. It is recommended to check the [market configuration](markets.md#listing-markets-on-a-vega-network) or [network parameters](create-market.md#where-do-i-find-the-current-network-parameters) when performing any margin calculation.
