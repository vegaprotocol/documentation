The Vega protocol software is built to provide a framework for creating markets for trading financial instruments that are based on the values of their underlying assets. All markets created using the Vega protocol have been initiated and voted on by tokeholders.

Participants that interact with a futures market created using Vega software can submit market, limit, pegged and liquidity commitment orders.
