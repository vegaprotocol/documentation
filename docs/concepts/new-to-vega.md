# Welcome! 

Welcome to Vega! This is a work-in-progress documentation site that focuses on Vega's restricted mainnet. 

If you have questions, join our community on [Discord](https://vega.xyz/discord)! We're keen to help.

## What is Vega?​
Vega is a protocol for creating and trading derivatives on a fully decentralised network. 

Currently, Vega is in restricted mainnet, which is run by a set of validators. There's also a Vega testnet called Fairground, which has trading enabled.

## What is Vega's restricted mainnet? 
Restricted mainnet is the first decentralised version of the Vega network. The first step of a three-stage launch process, it will be followed by alpha mainnet, which will have trading with limits, and v1 mainnet with unrestricted trading. 

* **Tokenholders can nominate validators** - Tokenholders earn staking rewards for securing the network.  <br/>
* **Network governance is encouraged** - Tokenholders can take part in proposing and voting on changes to network configuration to define the optimal network configuration in preparation for the alpha release. <br/>
* **Trading is disabled** - It will not be possible to create markets and trade on this version of mainnet. 

Although restricted mainnet is a live, decentralised network that allows tokenholders to interact with it, it is also an **extended test phase**. 

Its functionality is limited and is riskier than networks that will follow it, and involves regularly scheduled software upgrades and downtime. There will probably some growing pains as the network is stress-tested and upgrades are rolled out.
