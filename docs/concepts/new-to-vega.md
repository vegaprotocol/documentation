# Welcome! 
Welcome to Vega! 

You are currently on the documenation for Vega's testnet network, called Fairground. Documentation you see will be for the Vega software version that Fairground is currently running. If you want to see info for mainnet, switch network in the top bar of this page.

If you have questions, join our community on [Discord](https://vega.xyz/discord)! We're keen to help.

## What is Vega?​
Vega is a protocol for creating and trading derivatives on a fully decentralised network. 

Currently, Vega is in alpha mainnet, which is run by a set of validators. There's also a Vega testnet called Fairground, where it's possible to try trading cash-settled futures on a test network.

## What is Vega's alpha mainnet? 
Alpha mainnet is the second decentralised version of the Vega network. The second step of a three-stage launch process, it will be followed by v1 mainnet.

* **Trade on cash-settled futures markets** - Trade on markets proposed and voted in by the community. <br/>
* **Tokenholders can nominate validators** - Tokenholders earn staking rewards for securing the network.  <br/>
* **Network governance is encouraged** - Tokenholders can take part in proposing and voting on changes to network configuration to define the optimal network configuration in preparation for the alpha release. <br/>

Its functionality is limited and is riskier than networks that will follow it, and involves regularly scheduled software upgrades and downtime. There will probably be some growing pains as the network is stress-tested and upgrades are rolled out.
