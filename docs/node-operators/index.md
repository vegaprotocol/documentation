The Vega network runs on a set of publicly maintained computers, or nodes, on the validator testnet. A Vega network needs validating nodes that take part in consensus, as well as data nodes that receive and store network events that can be queried.

All nodes are running the same 'vega' codebase with the latest releases available on [GitHub](https://github.com/vegaprotocol/vega).

Find out how to maintain and upgrade a node by working through the instructions below.

If you want to know  more about how nodes work on Vega, read **[validating nodes](/docs/testnet/concepts/vega-chain#validating-nodes)** to explore the different types of nodes that run a Vega network, how they're chosen, and what impact their scores have on their status.
