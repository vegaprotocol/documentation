The [vega](https://github.com/vegaprotocol/vega/releases) and [data-node](https://github.com/vegaprotocol/data-node/releases) release pages offer pre-built binaries for MacOS, Windows and Linux. For production use we recommend using the Linux binary on Ubuntu as this is the platform used by all the node on the fairground testnet and is de facto the most widely tested so far.

If the pre-built binaries don't work or are unavailable for your system, you will need to build the [binaries from sources](./from_source).
