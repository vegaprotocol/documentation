## Setting up a data node
To set up a data node, you must first have followed the guide to [install and set up a Vega node](setup-server.md).

A data node must be run in conjunction with a Vega node. The Vega node will send the events it receives from the network and the events it creates to the data node, which will then store them in a database. An API is provided to query the data stored by the data node.

The database used by the data node is a PostgreSQL database with the Timescale extension installed. The database can be a dedicated database server, a docker container, or an embedded version of PostgreSql with Timescale installed that is provided by Vega.

:::note Operating system 
The following instructions assume you are installing on a Ubuntu Linux machine as explained in the [server setup guide](setup-server#os-and-software).
:::

## Pre-requisites

### Vega core

Please follow the instructions in the [server setup guide](setup-server.md) to install Vega.

### PostgreSQL and TimescaleDB full installation

We have tested and recommend using version 2.8.0 of the TimescaleDB plugin with Postgres 14. 

The installation instructions can be found in [Timescales Documentation](https://docs.timescale.com/install/latest/self-hosted/installation-debian/).

Refer to the [PostgreSQL documentation](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/14/index.html) for more detailed information on setting up a PostgreSQL database.

:::note Linux users
To ensure you install the correct version of TimescaleDB, you can use the notes at the bottom of the [Timescales Documentation for Debian](https://docs.timescale.com/install/latest/self-hosted/installation-debian/).

MacOS users
To ensure you install the correct version of TimescaleDB, you can use the notes at the bottom of the [Timescales Documentation for Mac](https://docs.timescale.com/install/latest/self-hosted/installation-macos/). 
:::

### PostgreSQL and TimescaleDB docker installation
If you prefer to run PostgreSQL and TimescaleDB in a docker container, you can use the following command to start a Postgresql docker container with TimescaleDB installed:

:::note 
This guide assumes you already have Docker installed on your system. For full installation guide consult Docker's [documentation](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/).
:::

```Shell
docker run -d \
    --rm \
    --name data-node-db \
    -e POSTGRES_USER=DATABASE_USER \
    -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=DATABASE_PASSWORD \
    -e POSTGRES_DB=DATABASE_NAME \
    -p LOCALDB_PORT:5432
    -v /host_path/to/snapshotsCopyTo:/snapshotsCopyTo:z \
    -v /host_path/to/snapshotsCopyFrom:/snapshotsCopyFrom:z \
    timescale/timescaledb:2.8.0-pg14
```

Where:

- `database_user` is the user name you want to use to connect to the database.
- `database_password` is the password you want to use to connect to the database.
- `database_name` is the name of the database you want to use for storing the data.
- `localdb_port` is the port you want to use to connect to the database on your local machine. (5432 is the default port for Postgresql database server and may not be available if you already have a postgresql database server running on your machine and want to use Docker for testing).
- `/host_path/to/snapshotsCopyTo` is the path on your host machine where you want to store the snapshots that are generated by data-node. Snapshots allow you to restore the database to a previous state.
- `/host_path/to/snapshotsCopyFrom` is the path on your host machine where you want to store the snapshots that are retrieved from IPFS and can be used to rebuild a data-node database from another data-node.

## Generating configuration files

#### Vega and Tendermint configuration
Before you can use Vega, you need to generate the default configuration files for Vega and Tendermint. You can then alter those to the specific requirements.

The below command will create home paths (if they don't already exist) and generate the configuration in the paths you chose.

```shell
vega init --home=YOUR_VEGA_HOME_PATH --tendermint-home=YOUR_TENDERMINT_HOME_PATH full
```

To update your node configuration, such as to set up ports for the APIs, edit the config file:

```shell
YOUR_VEGA_HOME_PATH/config/node/config.toml
```

:::note For more information about setting up a validator node, see the [validator node setup guide](setup-validator.md).
:::

#### Data node configuration
To generate the configuration files you need for the data node, you can use the following command:

```shell
vega datanode init --home=YOUR_DATA_NODE_HOME_PATH CHAIN_ID
```
Find the `CHAIN_ID` by going to the relevant network genesis file in the relevant networks repo. 

Visit [networks](https://github.com/vegaprotocol/networks/) for mainnet or [networks-internal](https://github.com/vegaprotocol/networks-internal) for a testnet network. 

To update your data node configuration, such as to set up ports for the APIs or database credentials, edit the config file:

```shell
YOUR_DATA_NODE_HOME_PATH/config/data-node/config.toml
```

## Configuration

### Vega
To configure your Vega node to work with a data node you need to update the `[Broker.Socket]` section of the Vega configuration file `YOUR_VEGA_HOME_PATH/config/node/config.toml` from false to:

```toml
  [Broker.Socket]
    ...
    Enabled = true
    ...
```

:::note 
While it's possible to run the data node and Vega node on separate machines, it's not recommended given the volume of data that will be transferred between the two.
:::

## Data Node

### Database configuration

Data node database configuration is defined under the `[SQLStore.ConnectionConfig]` section of the data node configuration file `YOUR_DATA_NODE_HOME_PATH/config/data-node/config.toml`:

```toml
  [SQLStore.ConnectionConfig]
    Host = "localhost"
    Port = 5432
    Username = "vega"
    Password = "vega"
    Database = "vega"
    MaxConnLifetime = "30m0s"
    MaxConnLifetimeJitter = "5m0s"
```

You should ensure the database configuration matches those of the database you created in the pre-requisite steps.

### Wipe on startup

:::warning Database wipe
The following will wipe the database on startup, so use with caution.

Once the database has been wiped, data-node will reconstruct the database tables and will allow you to repopulate the data from the network chain, however this can take a long time depending on the size of the chain.
:::

If you want to wipe the database on startup, you can set the `WipeOnStartup` flag to `true` in the data node configuration file `YOUR_DATA_NODE_HOME_PATH/config/data-node/config.toml`:

```toml
[SQLStore]
  WipeOnStartup = true
```

### Embedded Postgres

:::warning
This is not recommended for use in production, but you can use it to test or learn about the system.
:::

If you do not have access to, or do not want to use a PostgreSQL database server, or a Postgres Docker container, it is possible to run a data node with an embedded version of Postgres. You can enable this by setting the flag:

```toml
[SQLStore]
  ...
  UseEmbedded = true
  ...
```

This will cause data node to download a specially prepared Postgresql package which is extracted to your local machine if it doesn't exist. A separate Postgresql process will be spawned by data node using the credentials you specified in the database configuration section. Once data node is stopped, the child Postgresql process will be stopped automatically.

### Buffered event source
When a data-node is restarted from snapshots, it is possible for the event queue to become flooded causing the Vega core to panic when the event queue is full and stop both the Vega core and data node.

To prevent this, the buffered event source flag is set to true by default. You can confirm this by looking at the following config section:

```toml
[Broker]
  ...
  UseBufferedEventSource = true
  ...
```

### Running Vega and data node
It is recommended to start the data node before starting the Vega node. By default if the `Broker.Socket.Enabled` flag is set to true, the Vega node will attempt to connect to the data node on startup. It will continue to try and connect for one minute before giving up.

To start the data node, run the following command:

```shell
vega datanode start --home=YOUR_DATA_NODE_HOME_PATH
```

To start Vega, run the following command:

```shell
vega start --home=YOUR_VEGA_HOME_PATH --tendermint-home=YOUR_TENDERMINT_HOME_PATH
```
