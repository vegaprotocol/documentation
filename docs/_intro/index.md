Vega is a protocol for creating and trading on dated future and perpetual derivatives markets and spot markets, on a fully decentralised network.

The Vega mainnet is run by a set of [validator nodes](../concepts/chain/validator-nodes.md). 

There's also a Vega testnet called Fairground, where you can try trading spot, cash-settled futures, and perpetuals on a test network.
