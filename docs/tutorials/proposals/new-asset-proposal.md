# Propose a new asset

Vega currently supports 2 asset types - internal assets, which are used for testing purposes, and ERC20 assets. ERC20 assets are supported [via the Vega bridge](../../api/bridge/index.md) - which is to say that they are deposited from and withdrawn to [Ethereum â†—](https://ethereum.org/). More token standards and chains are on the roadmap.

You can see [using the REST endpoint](../../api/rest/data-node/data#tag/TradingDataService/operation/TradingDataService_Assets) or [the 'assets' GraphQL query](../../graphql/queries/assets). This will show you all of the currently supported assets. If an asset that you would like to see on the network is not listed, a governance proposal can be made to list the asset. If and when the vote passes, the network validators will then [enable the asset on the bridge contract](../../api/bridge/contracts/ERC20_Bridge_Logic#tag/TradingDataService/operation/TradingDataService_ERC20WithdrawalApproval) which will enable deposits and withdrawals for that token.

In the tabs below you'll see an annotated example, which describes what each field is for, a JSON example, and command line examples for different operating systems, that you'll need to update with the relevant details before submitting.
