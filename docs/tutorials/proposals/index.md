<Topic />

Governance with tokenholder participation is essential on Vega. Markets and assets can only be added through governance, and network parameters, markets and assets all must be amended through governance as well.

This section includes sample proposals that you can amend and submit via the command line.
* [New market proposal](./new-market-proposal.md)
* [Update market proposal](./update-market-proposal.md)
* [Change network parameter proposal](./network-parameter-proposal.md)
* [New freeform proposal](./freeform-proposal.md)
