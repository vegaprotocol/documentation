# Create a freeform proposal
Freeform proposals allow the community to propose and vote on matters which don't change any of the behaviour of the currently running Vega blockchain.

At enactment time, no changes are effected on the system, but the record of how token holders voted will be stored on chain. 

## Requirements

You will need:

- A connected [Vega wallet](/docs/tools/vega-wallet/index.md), with your wallet name and public key to hand
- A minimum of whichever is larger, associated with that public key: <NetworkParameter frontMatter={frontMatter} param="governance.proposal.freeform.minProposerBalance" hideName={true} suffix="tokens"/> or <NetworkParameter frontMatter={frontMatter} param="spam.protection.proposal.min.tokens" hideName={true} suffix="tokens"/>
- Familiarity with [governance on Vega](../../concepts/vega-protocol.md#governance)

## Templates and submitting

In the tabs below you'll see an annotated example, which describes what each field is for, a JSON example that can be used to submit on the token dApp, and command line examples for different operating systems. **You'll need to replace the example data with the relevant details before submitting.**

<Tabs groupId="newFreeform">
  <TabItem value="annotated" label="Annotated example">
    <NewFreeformAnnotated />
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="json" label="Token dApp (JSON)">
		<JSONInstructions />
		<NewFreeformJSON />
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="cmd" label="Command line (Linux / OSX)">
		<TerminalInstructions />
		<NewFreeformCMD />
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="win" label="Command line (Windows)">
		<TerminalInstructions />
		<NewFreeformWin />
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Voting and enactment

All proposals are voted on by the community. To vote, community members need, at a minimum, the larger of <NetworkParameter frontMatter={frontMatter} param="spam.protection.voting.min.tokens" suffix="tokens" hideName={true} /> or <NetworkParameter frontMatter={frontMatter} param="governance.proposal.freeform.minVoterBalance" suffix="tokens" hideName={true} />, associated to their Vega key. 

Your proposal will need [participation](../../concepts/vega-protocol#how-the-outcome-is-calculated) of <NetworkParameter frontMatter={frontMatter} param="governance.proposal.freeform.requiredParticipation" formatter="percent" hideName={true} /> and a voting majority of <NetworkParameter frontMatter={frontMatter} param="governance.proposal.freeform.requiredMajority" formatter="percent" hideName={true} />, so having community support is essential.

Building support is down to you. Share your proposal in [the _Free Form Proposals_ forum](https://community.vega.xyz/c/fairground-testnet-governance/free-form-proposals-testnet/36) on Vega community. You may also wish to share on [Discord](https://vega.xyz/discord).

Proposal owners who invite feedback, engage with comments, and make revisions to meet the needs of the community are more likely to be successful.
