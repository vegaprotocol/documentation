:::tip Playground
The [JSON-RPC playground](./openrpc-api-playground) has the full list of methods that you can call in an easy-to-use test environment.
:::

## session.connect_wallet
> Initiates a connection between a wallet and a third-party application.

This method initiates a connection between a wallet and a third-party application.

The client has to review the request, and, if they accept it, select the wallet they want to use for this connection.

A connection token is generated and returned to the third-party application. This token is meant to be used in protected methods.

**Supported connections:**
- Multiple wallets connected for the same hostname. Each connection will have a different token.
- A single wallet connected to multiple hostnames. Each connection will have a different token.
- Combination of the above setups.

However, it's not possible to have multiple connections on the same wallet for the same hostname. The previous connection will be terminated and a new token will be generated.

This method should be the entry point of every third-party application. Once connected, see the method `get_permissions`.

### Parameters
| Parameter name  |  Type  |  Description |
|------------------|--------|--------|
| **hostname** | string | The name of the third-party application initiating the connection. |

### Result: `token`

### Examples
#### Accepting a connection from "vega.xyz"
> The third-party application "vega.xyz" requests a connection to a wallet and the client accepts.

##### Parameters
```json
{
    "id": 1,
    "jsonrpc": "2.0",
    "method": "session.connect_wallet",
    "params": {
        "hostname": "vega.xyz"
    }
}
```

##### Result
```json
{
    "name": "Success",
    "value": {
        "token": "hZKSx0snBvikp2NGMJdKPHU5qvloSeqpqbJg6BsMwCcqX4iZvvy99BV2l13oeyEG"
    }
}
```



### Errors
- **Client error** (3000): the client closed the connection
- **Client error** (3001): the client rejected the request
- **Server error** (-32001): the request has been interrupted
---

## session.disconnect_wallet
> Ends the connection between the third-party application and the wallet.

This method ends the connection between the third-party application and the wallet. The token is, then, no longer valid.

Calling this method with an invalid token doesn't fail.

### Parameters
| Parameter name  |  Type  |  Description |
|------------------|--------|--------|
| **token** | string | - |

### Result: `No result`

### Examples
#### Disconnection from "vega.xyz"
> The third-party application "vega.xyz" requests a disconnection to a wallet using a valid token.

##### Parameters
```json
{
    "id": 1,
    "jsonrpc": "2.0",
    "method": "session.disconnect_wallet",
    "params": {
        "token": "hZKSx0snBvikp2NGMJdKPHU5qvloSeqpqbJg6BsMwCcqX4iZvvy99BV2l13oeyEG"
    }
}
```

##### Result
```json
{
    "name": "Success",
    "value": null
}
```

## session.get_permissions
> Returns the permissions set on the wallet for the third-party application.

This method returns the permissions set on the wallet for the third-party application.

This method should be called, by the third-party application, right after it successfully connected to a wallet, to ensure it has sufficient permissions to call the method it relies on. If the third-party application doesn't have enough permissions, see the method `request_permissions`.

### Parameters
| Parameter name  |  Type  |  Description |
|------------------|--------|--------|
| **token** | string | - |

### Result: `permissions`
| Result key  |  Type  |  Description | Example |
|------------------|--------|--------|---------|
| public_keys | string | The different access modes a permission can have. | -|

### Examples
#### Get permissions set for "vega.xyz"
> The third-party application "vega.xyz" wants to know the permissions that have been set on the wallet in use.

##### Parameters
```json
{
    "id": 1,
    "jsonrpc": "2.0",
    "method": "session.get_permissions",
    "params": {
        "token": "hZKSx0snBvikp2NGMJdKPHU5qvloSeqpqbJg6BsMwCcqX4iZvvy99BV2l13oeyEG"
    }
}
```

##### Result
```json
{
    "name": "Success",
    "value": {
        "public_keys": "read"
    }
}
```

## session.request_permissions
> Requests permissions update for the third-party application.

This method allows a third-party application to request new permissions to access the methods it requires.

All permissions the third-party relies on have to be specified. If a permission is omitted, it will be considered as no longer required and, as a result, be automatically revoked.

The client has to review the permissions.

### Parameters
| Parameter name  |  Type  |  Description |
|------------------|--------|--------|
| **token** | string | - |
| **requestedPermissions** | object | - |

### Result: `permissions`
| Result key  |  Type  |  Description | Example |
|------------------|--------|--------|---------|
| public_keys | string | The different access modes a permission can have. | -|

### Examples
#### Updating permissions for "vega.xyz"
> The third-party application "vega.xyz" requests an update of its permissions and the client accepts.

##### Parameters
```json
{
    "id": 1,
    "jsonrpc": "2.0",
    "method": "session.request_permissions",
    "params": {
        "token": "hZKSx0snBvikp2NGMJdKPHU5qvloSeqpqbJg6BsMwCcqX4iZvvy99BV2l13oeyEG",

        }
    }
}
```


#### Updating permissions for "vega.xyz" with omitted permission
> The third-party application "vega.xyz" omits a permission during the update and the client accepts. This automatically marks the omitted permission as revoked.

##### Parameters

{
    "id": 1,
    "jsonrpc": "2.0",
    "method": "session.request_permissions",
    "params": {
