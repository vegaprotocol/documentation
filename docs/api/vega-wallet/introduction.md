Build on and integrate with the Vega Wallet service using the available APIs. 

## V1 API
The **REST API** is being deprecated and will only be supported until the JSON-RPC API is out of alpha. 

See the [REST API for Vega Wallet](./v1-api/rest-api.md) documentation.

## V2 API
The **JSON-RPC API** and its endpoint **`/v2/requests`** is in the alpha phase, and will be replacing the v1 REST API. If you discover any issues, please raise them on the [feedback board â†—](https://github.com/vegaprotocol/feedback/discussions).
