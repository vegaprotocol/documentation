arbitrary serialized protocol buffer message along with a\nURL that describes the type of the serialized message.\n\nProtobuf library provides support to pack/unpack Any values in the form\nof utility functions or additional generated methods of the Any type.\n\nExample 1: Pack and unpack a message in C++.\n\n    Foo foo = ...;\n    Any any;\n    any.PackFrom(foo);\n    ...\n    if (any.UnpackTo(&foo)) {\n      ...\n    }\n\nExample 2: Pack and unpack a message in Java.\n\n    Foo foo = ...;\n    Any any = Any.pack(foo);\n    ...\n    if (any.is(Foo.class)) {\n      foo = any.unpack(Foo.class);\n    }\n    // or ...\n    if (any.isSameTypeAs(Foo.getDefaultInstance())) {\n      foo = any.unpack(Foo.getDefaultInstance());\n    }\n\nExample 3: Pack and unpack a message in Python.\n\n    foo = Foo(...)\n    any = Any()\n    any.Pack(foo)\n    ...\n    if any.Is(Foo.DESCRIPTOR):\n      any.Unpack(foo)\n      ...\n\nExample 4: Pack and unpack a message in Go\n\n     foo := &pb.Foo{...}\n     any, err := anypb.New(foo)\n     if err != nil {\n       ...\n     }\n     ...\n     foo := &pb.Foo{}\n     if err := any.UnmarshalTo(foo); err != nil {\n       ...\n     }\n\nThe pack methods provided by protobuf library will by default use\n'type.googleapis.com/full.type.name' as the type URL and the unpack\nmethods only use the fully qualified type name after the last '/'\nin the type URL, for example \"foo.bar.com/x/y.z\" will yield type\nname \"y.z\".\n\nJSON\n\nThe JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the regular\nrepresentation of the deserialized, embedded message, with an\nadditional field `@type` which contains the type URL. Example:\n\n    package google.profile;\n    message Person {\n      string first_name = 1;\n      string last_name = 2;\n    }\n\n    {\n      \"@type\": \"type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person\",\n      \"firstName\": <string>,\n      \"lastName\": <string>\n    }\n\nIf the embedded message type is well-known and has a custom JSON\nrepresentation, that representation will be embedded adding a field\n`value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the `@type`\nfield. Example (for message [google.protobuf.Duration][]):\n\n    {\n      \"@type\": \"type.googleapis.com/google.protobuf.Duration\",\n      \"value\": \"1.212s\"\n    }","properties":{"@type":{"description":"A URL/resource name that uniquely identifies the type of the serialized\nprotocol buffer message. This string must contain at least\none \"/\" character. The last segment of the URL's path must represent\nthe fully qualified name of the type (as in\n`path/google.protobuf.Duration`). The name should be in a canonical form\n(e.g., leading \".\" is not accepted).\n\nIn practice, teams usually precompile into the binary all types that they\nexpect it to use in the context of Any. However, for URLs which use the\nscheme `http`, `https`, or no scheme, one can optionally set up a type\nserver that maps type URLs to message definitions as follows:\n\n* If no scheme is provided, `https` is assumed.\n* An HTTP GET on the URL must yield a [google.protobuf.Type][]\n  value in binary format, or produce an error.\n* Applications are allowed to cache lookup results based on the\n  URL, or have them precompiled into a binary to avoid any\n  lookup. Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be preserved\n  on changes to types.

Example (for message [google.protobuf.Duration][]):\n\n    {\n      \"@type\": \"type.googleapis.com/google.protobuf.Duration\",\n      \"value\": \"1.212s\"\n    }","properties":{"@type":{"description":"A URL/resource name that uniquely identifies the type of the serialized\nprotocol buffer message.

## List successor markets



Given a market ID, return the full lineage of markets since inception, or all successor markets since and including
the given market ID. The markets will be returned in succession order, i.e. the market at position i will be the parent
of the market at position i+1.

Normalisers are used to convert the data returned from the contract method
into a standard format. The key of the map is the name of the property,
which identifies the specific piece of data to other parts of the data
sourcing framework, for example filters. The value is a JSONPath expression
for expressing where in the contract call result the required data is
located, for example $[0] indicates the first result. $[1].price would look
in the second result returned from the contract for a structure with a key
called 'price' and use that if it exists.

Normalisers are used to convert the data returned from the contract method
into a standard format. The key of the map is the name of the property,
which identifies the specific piece of data to other parts of the data
sourcing framework, for example filters. The value is a JSONPath expression
for expressing where in the contract call result the required data is
located, for example $[0] indicates the first result. $[1].price would look
in the second result returned from the contract for a structure with a key
called 'price' and use that if it exists.

Normalisers are used to convert the data returned from the contract method
into a standard format. The key of the map is the name of the property,
which identifies the specific piece of data to other parts of the data
sourcing framework, for example filters. The value is a JSONPath expression
for expressing where in the contract call result the required data is
located, for example $[0] indicates the first result. $[1].price would look
in the second result returned from the contract for a structure with a key
called 'price' and use that if it exists.

Normalisers are used to convert the data returned from the contract method
into a standard format. The key of the map is the name of the property,
which identifies the specific piece of data to other parts of the data
sourcing framework, for example filters. The value is a JSONPath expression
for expressing where in the contract call result the required data is
located, for example $[0] indicates the first result. $[1].price would look
in the second result returned from the contract for a structure with a key
called 'price' and use that if it exists.

Normalisers are used to convert the data returned from the contract method
into a standard format. The key of the map is the name of the property,
which identifies the specific piece of data to other parts of the data
sourcing framework, for example filters. The value is a JSONPath expression
for expressing where in the contract call result the required data is
located, for example $[0] indicates the first result. $[1].price would look
in the second result returned from the contract for a structure with a key
called 'price' and use that if it exists.

Normalisers are used to convert the data returned from the contract method
into a standard format. The key of the map is the name of the property,
which identifies the specific piece of data to other parts of the data
sourcing framework, for example filters. The value is a JSONPath expression
for expressing where in the contract call result the required data is
located, for example $[0] indicates the first result. $[1].price would look
in the second result returned from the contract for a structure with a key
called 'price' and use that if it exists.

Normalisers are used to convert the data returned from the contract method
into a standard format. The key of the map is the name of the property,
which identifies the specific piece of data to other parts of the data
sourcing framework, for example filters. The value is a JSONPath expression
for expressing where in the contract call result the required data is
located, for example $[0] indicates the first result. $[1].price would look
in the second result returned from the contract for a structure with a key
called 'price' and use that if it exists.

sourcing framework, for example filters. The value is a JSONPath expression
for expressing where in the contract call result the required data is
located, for example $[0] indicates the first result. $[1].price would look
in the second result returned from the contract for a structure with a key
called 'price' and use that if it exists.
