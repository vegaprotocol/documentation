## Balances



`ListBalanceChanges` is for querying the change in account balances over a period of time.

An account is defined as a set of (asset_id, type, party_id, market_id).
- Every account has an associated asset and type.
- Certain account types (for example, the global reward pool) do not have an associated party.
  These are denoted by the special party identifier 'network'
- Certain account types do not have an associated market (for example general party accounts).
  These are denoted by the special market identifier '' (the empty string)

`ListBalanceChangesRequest` will return a list of
`(vega_time, asset_id, account_type, party_id, market_id, balance)`
With a row for each block at which a given account's balance changes.
