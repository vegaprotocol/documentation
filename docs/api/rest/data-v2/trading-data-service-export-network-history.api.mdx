title: "Export network history as CSV"
description: "Export CSV table data from network history between two block heights.

The requested block heights must fall on network history segment boundaries, which can
be discovered by calling the API to list all network history segments. By default
segments contain 1000 blocks. In that case ranges such as (1, 1000), (1001, 2000), (1, 3000)
would all fall on segment boundaries and be valid.

The generated CSV file is compressed into a ZIP file and returned, with the file name
in the following format: [chain id]-[table name]-[start block]-[end block].zip

In gRPC, results are returned in a chunked stream of base64 encoded data.

Through the REST gateway, the base64 data chunks are decoded and streamed as a
`content-type: application/zip` HTTP response.

The CSV exported data uses a comma as a DELIMITER between fields, and ' for QUOTE-ing fields.

If a value contains any of: DELIMITER, QUOTE, carriage return, or line feed then the whole
value is prefixed and suffixed by the QUOTE character and any occurrence within
the value of a QUOTE character preceded by another QUOTE.

A NULL is output as the NULL parameter string and is not quoted, while a non-NULL value
matching the NULL parameter string is quoted.

For example, with the default settings, a NULL is written as an unquoted empty string,
while an empty string data value is written with double quotes.

Note that CSV files produced may contain quoted values containing embedded carriage returns and line feeds.
Thus the files are not strictly one line per table row like text-format files.

The first row of the CSV file is a header that describes the contents of each column
in subsequent rows.

Usually the ZIP file will contain only a single CSV file. However it is possible that
the (from_block, to_block) request spans over a range of blocks in which the underlying
schema of the database changes. For example, a column may have been added, removed, or renamed.

If this happens, the CSV file will be split at the point of the schema change and the zip
file will contain multiple CSV files, with a potentially different set of headers. The
'version' number of the database schema is part of the in the CSV filename:

 [chain id]-[table name]-[schema version]-[start block]-[end block].zip

For example, a zip file might be called mainnet-sometable-000001-003000.zip

And contain two CSV files: mainnet-sometable-1-000001-002000.csv:

timestamp, value
1, foo
2, bar

And mainnet-sometable-2-002001-003000.csv:

timestamp, value, extra_value
3, baz, apple

It is worth noting that the schema will not change within a single network history segment.

## Export network history as CSV



Export CSV table data from network history between two block heights.

The requested block heights must fall on network history segment boundaries, which can
be discovered by calling the API to list all network history segments. By default
segments contain 1000 blocks. In that case ranges such as (1, 1000), (1001, 2000), (1, 3000)
would all fall on segment boundaries and be valid.

The generated CSV file is compressed into a ZIP file and returned, with the file name
in the following format: [chain id]-[table name]-[start block]-[end block].zip

In gRPC, results are returned in a chunked stream of base64 encoded data.

Through the REST gateway, the base64 data chunks are decoded and streamed as a
`content-type: application/zip` HTTP response.

The CSV exported data uses a comma as a DELIMITER between fields, and " for QUOTE-ing fields.

If a value contains any of: DELIMITER, QUOTE, carriage return, or line feed then the whole
value is prefixed and suffixed by the QUOTE character and any occurrence within
the value of a QUOTE character preceded by another QUOTE.

A NULL is output as the NULL parameter string and is not quoted, while a non-NULL value
matching the NULL parameter string is quoted.

For example, with the default settings, a NULL is written as an unquoted empty string,
while an empty string data value is written with double quotes.

Note that CSV files produced may contain quoted values containing embedded carriage returns and line feeds.
Thus the files are not strictly one line per table row like text-format files.

The first row of the CSV file is a header that describes the contents of each column
in subsequent rows.

Usually the ZIP file will contain only a single CSV file. However it is possible that
the (from_block, to_block) request spans over a range of blocks in which the underlying
schema of the database changes. For example, a column may have been added, removed, or renamed.

If this happens, the CSV file will be split at the point of the schema change and the zip
file will contain multiple CSV files, with a potentially different set of headers. The
'version' number of the database schema is part of the in the CSV filename:

 [chain id]-[table name]-[schema version]-[start block]-[end block].zip

For example, a zip file might be called mainnet-sometable-000001-003000.zip

And contain two CSV files: mainnet-sometable-1-000001-002000.csv:

timestamp, value
1, foo
2, bar

And mainnet-sometable-2-002001-003000.csv:

timestamp, value, extra_value
3, baz, apple

It is worth noting that the schema will not change within a single network history segment.

Message that represents an arbitrary HTTP body. It should only be used for
payload formats that can't be represented as JSON, such as raw binary or
an HTML page.


This message can be used both in streaming and non-streaming API methods in
the request as well as the response.

It can be used as a top-level request field, which is convenient if one
wants to extract parameters from either the URL or HTTP template into the
request fields and also want access to the raw HTTP body.

Example:

    message GetResourceRequest {
      // A unique request id.
      string request_id = 1;

      // The raw HTTP body is bound to this field.
      google.api.HttpBody http_body = 2;

    }

    service ResourceService {
      rpc GetResource(GetResourceRequest)
        returns (google.api.HttpBody);
      rpc UpdateResource(google.api.HttpBody)
        returns (google.protobuf.Empty);

    }

Example with streaming methods:

    service CaldavService {
      rpc GetCalendar(stream google.api.HttpBody)
        returns (stream google.api.HttpBody);
      rpc UpdateCalendar(stream google.api.HttpBody)
        returns (stream google.api.HttpBody);

    }

Use of this type only changes how the request and response bodies are
handled, all other features will continue to work unchanged.
