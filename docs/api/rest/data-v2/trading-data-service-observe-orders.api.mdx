Example:\n\n    package google.profile;\n    message Person {\n      string first_name = 1;\n      string last_name = 2;\n    }\n\n    {\n      \"@type\": \"type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person\",\n      \"firstName\": <string>,\n      \"lastName\": <string>\n    }\n\nIf the embedded message type is well-known and has a custom JSON\nrepresentation, that representation will be embedded adding a field\n`value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the `@type`\nfield. Example (for message [google.protobuf.Duration][]):\n\n    {\n      \"@type\": \"type.googleapis.com/google.protobuf.Duration\",\n      \"value\": \"1.212s\"\n    }","properties":{"@type":{"description":"A URL/resource name that uniquely identifies the type of the serialized\nprotocol buffer message.

Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be preserved\n  on changes to types. (Use versioned type names to manage\n  breaking changes.)\n\nNote: this functionality is not currently available in the official\nprotobuf release, and it is not used for type URLs beginning with\ntype.googleapis.com.\n\nSchemes other than `http`, `https` (or the empty scheme) might be\nused with implementation specific semantics.","type":"string"}},"type":"object","title":"protobufAny"},"type":"array"},"message":{"type":"string"}},"type":"object","title":"googlerpcStatus"}}},"description":"An unexpected error response."}},"tags":["Orders"],"description":"Subscribe to a stream of orders","operationId":"TradingDataService_ObserveOrders","method":"get","path":"/api/v2/stream/orders","servers":[{"url":"https://api.n06.testnet.vega.xyz","description":"n06 (data node)"},{"url":"https://api.n07.testnet.vega.xyz","description":"n07 (data node)"}],"info":{"title":"Vega data node APIs","version":"v0.71.2"},"postman":{"name":"Observe orders","description":{"content":"Subscribe to a stream of orders","type":"text/plain"},"url":{"path":["api","v2","stream","orders"],"host":["{{baseUrl}}"],"query":[{"disabled":false,"description":{"content":"Market ID to filter for.
