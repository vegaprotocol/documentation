title: "Ledger entries list"
description: "List ledger entries by asset, market, party, account type and transfer type within the given date range.
This query requests and sums the number of ledger entries from a given subset of accounts, specified via the 'filter' argument.
It returns a time series (implemented as a list of AggregateLedgerEntry structs), with a row for every time
the summed ledger entries of the set of specified accounts changes.
Listed entries should be limited to a single party from each side only. If zero or more than one party is provided
for each of the sides - sending and receiving accounts, the query returns an error.

Entries can be queried by:
  - listing ledger entries with filtering on the sending account (market ID, asset ID, account type)
  - listing ledger entries with filtering on the receiving account (market ID, asset ID, account type)
  - listing ledger entries with filtering on the sending AND receiving account
  - listing ledger entries with filtering on the transfer type (on top of above filters or as a standalone option)"

## Ledger entries list



List ledger entries by asset, market, party, account type and transfer type within the given date range.
This query requests and sums the number of ledger entries from a given subset of accounts, specified via the 'filter' argument.
It returns a time series (implemented as a list of AggregateLedgerEntry structs), with a row for every time
the summed ledger entries of the set of specified accounts changes.
Listed entries should be limited to a single party from each side only. If zero or more than one party is provided
for each of the sides - sending and receiving accounts, the query returns an error.

Entries can be queried by:
  - listing ledger entries with filtering on the sending account (market ID, asset ID, account type)
  - listing ledger entries with filtering on the receiving account (market ID, asset ID, account type)
  - listing ledger entries with filtering on the sending AND receiving account
  - listing ledger entries with filtering on the transfer type (on top of above filters or as a standalone option)
