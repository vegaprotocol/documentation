title: LedgerEntries
description: "Get ledger entries by asset, market, party, account type, transfer type within the given date range.
This query requests and sums number of the ledger entries of a given subset of accounts, specified via the 'filter' argument.
It returns a timeseries (implemented as a list of AggregateLedgerEntry structs), with a row for every time
the summed ledger entries of the set of specified accounts changes.
Listed queries should be limited to a single party from each side only. If no or more than one parties are provided
for sending and receiving accounts - the query returns error.

Entries can be queried by:
  - listing ledger entries with filtering on the sending account (market_id, asset_id, account_type)
  - listing ledger entries with filtering on the receiving account (market_id, asset_id, account_type)
  - listing ledger entries with filtering on the sending AND receiving account
  - listing ledger entries with filtering on the transfer type (on top of above filters or as a standalone option)"

## LedgerEntries



Get ledger entries by asset, market, party, account type, transfer type within the given date range.
This query requests and sums number of the ledger entries of a given subset of accounts, specified via the 'filter' argument.
It returns a timeseries (implemented as a list of AggregateLedgerEntry structs), with a row for every time
the summed ledger entries of the set of specified accounts changes.
Listed queries should be limited to a single party from each side only. If no or more than one parties are provided
for sending and receiving accounts - the query returns error.

Entries can be queried by:
  - listing ledger entries with filtering on the sending account (market_id, asset_id, account_type)
  - listing ledger entries with filtering on the receiving account (market_id, asset_id, account_type)
  - listing ledger entries with filtering on the sending AND receiving account
  - listing ledger entries with filtering on the transfer type (on top of above filters or as a standalone option)
