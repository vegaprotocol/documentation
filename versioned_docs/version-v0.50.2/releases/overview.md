## Vega core software
The Vega core software is public on a business-source licence, so you can both view the repository change logs, and refer here for summary release notes for each version that the validators use to run the Vega mainnet. Releases are listed with their semantic version number and the date the release was made available to mainnet validators.

### Versions 0.50.4 | 2022-06-29
This release was shared with validators on 29 June, 2022. The validators released it to the mainnet network on on 30 June, 2022.

This is a patch release to address two high priority bugs seen in version 0.50.3.

A critical defect was identified on mainnet 0.50.3 where some staking events on Ethereum were replicated multiple times on Vega. During investigations it was identified that some validators were still running their event forwarder as an external service, which forwards events in a slightly different format, meaning those events were not successfully deduplicated. The defect that made it non-deterministic and not successfully deduplicate has now been resolved in [5510](https://github.com/vegaprotocol/vega/pull/5510) - fix: dedupe sorting made consistent

When restarting from a checkpoint file during the 0.50.3 deployment, at the end of the epoch the reward was paid as expected. However, the `rewardScore` field for the validators in that first epoch was missing in GraphQL. For all following epochs the `rewardScore` field was present as it should be. The cause was identified: when the core emits the event at the end of the first epoch, after the checkpoint restart, it was emitted with the wrong epoch sequence. This has now been resolved in [5515](https://github.com/vegaprotocol/vega/pull/5515) - fix: emit `rewardScore` correctly when loading from checkpoint

### Versions 0.50.3-0.49.8 combined | 2022-04-27
This release was shared with validators on 27 April, 2022. The validators released it to the mainnet network on 22 June, 2022.

The primary focus of this and the next upcoming releases has been to complete the final remaining features, progress data-node improvements for scalability and to add test coverage and fix bugs.

Note: While many of the features below are related to trading, it is not yet enabled on mainnet. 

**Proposals to change market parameters**: After a market has been proposed and enacted, changes to the market parameters can be proposed in a different governance action. Tokenholders will be able to submit proposals to change market parameters.

To change any market parameter, the proposer will submit the same data as if they were to create a market, except for the liquidity commitment, however this submission would contain the desired updates to the fields / structures that they wish to be changed. Some of the market parameters will not be able to be changed: market decimal places, position decimal places, settlement asset and the market name.

**Spam Protection**: This release introduces a rate-limiting scheme to prevent clients from attacking the network by spamming the network with requests. Unlike many other systems Vega does not charge a transaction fee; fees are only charged on trades. To prevent spamming, there is a client-side Proof of Work (PoW) mechanism required along with all transaction submissions. The difficulty of the PoW puzzle can be adjusted by governance, and is low for most use-case scenarios. It is automatically increased if a single client submits an abnormal number of transactions.

This rate-limiting is based upon a client-side PoW which is quite different from the PoW term predominantly used for proof-of-work blockchains and associated with high energy consumption.

**Checkpoint Improvements**: Checkpoints have been simplified. Before, validators would have to have a synchronisation period between nodes in order to reconcile the state from Ethereum when restarting the network from a checkpoint. This was due to the fact that the validators and staking balances were not stored in the checkpoint files.

This data is now stored in the checkpoints, which means that it is now possible to restart from checkpoints asynchronously, which removes the synchronisation period (when feasible). This will become especially important as validator numbers increase and the network sees validators joining and leaving based on stake.

**Add Ethereum key rotation support**: Vega now supports validators rotating their Ethereum keys. Ethereum keys are required so that validators can allow deposits and withdrawals via the Ethereum bridge. The controller of the bridge is a multisig bundle, and periodically validators will want to change their keys but still be part of the controlling group. This feature allows them to do this with a new transaction type.

**Liquidity Provision Improvements**: Over the last month, the project team has been running a number of community incentives, including around liquidity provision. A number of bugs and enhancements have been introduced as a result of the incentive. These include:
* In some cases, amending liquidity orders triggered a liquidity auction. This was due to the fact that an order amend was effectively equivalent to a cancel and submit. During investigations it was found that if there was only 1 order on either side of the book, amending it would trigger an auction because, temporarily, there were no orders left
* A fix has been implemented to ensure that the margin is correctly released when an LP order is cancelled
* With the introduction of the market decimal places feature (see below), an issue was found related to decimal places and price bounds. This fix ensures that LP orders are adjusted to the min/max price according to the market precision

**Tendermint**: The current version of Tendermint being used by Vega has a bug where a transaction would pass `checkTx` but was never added to the memory pool. Tendermint has fixed the bug and the protocol is now able to use `sendTx` sync successfully. Therefore, if any transactions are rejected by the memory pool an error is raised to indicate why this has happened. 

**EEF internalising**: The Ethereum Event Forwarder is functionality inside Vega that allows the network to be aware of activity on the Ethereum network. When the forwarder service is aware of events, such as the staking or unlocking of tokens, it translates and passes the events to the tendermint blockchain in Vega. Originally this was deployed as a single service alongside the Vega node, with the node needing to be configured to accept events from the forwarder service. This has now been rewritten and internalised into the Vega node, which simplifies the configuration of running a Vega node and makes it easier to deploy. Other benefits of doing this include it being easier to maintain and add future enhancements, which will be described in future release notes.

**Data node**: In order to have a scalable solution for accessing data, work has begun on migrating the datastore into a postgres with time-series database. Migrations of assets, accounts, markets, market data, orders and trades have been done. The changes have been made to the codebase and live in parallel with the existing solution. As the remaining APIs are migrated and testing is completed, the old datastore and APIs will be removed.

**Market decimal places**: In this release, the protocol now makes it possible to configure a market for which orders can only be priced in increments of a specific size. This is done by specifying a different (smaller) number of decimal places than its settlement asset supports. To explain this, consider a market that settles in GBP. This market can now be configured to have 0 decimal places so that the price levels on the orderbook will be separated by at least £1, rather than the default £0.01.

**Offsets for pegged and liquidity commitment orders**: The numbers used to offset how far from the reference price a pegged and liquidity provision order (respectively) can now only be input as positive. Whether they need to be added or subtracted from the price will be dependent on the order side.

Read more: [Pegged orders](https://github.com/vegaprotocol/specs/blob/master/protocol/0037-OPEG-pegged_orders.md)

**Liquidity provision improvements**: The `LiquidityProvisionSubmission` API was used for submitting, amending and cancelling liquidity provision.  To both simplify the code and have a more explicit user experience a breaking change has been implemented to split these into three API commands. 

**Floating point determinism**: Computations within a blockchain-based system need to be deterministic as the application state between nodes replicating it can start to differ potentially resulting in consensus failure. The protocol has been improved so that if the system has a differing floating point value there is a resolution strategy to reach consensus on the value that should be used. This is key due to the fact that validators will be running different hardware that could increase the chances of this happening.

**Snapshots**: In order to simplify and streamline the process for both restarting or adding a node on the Vega network, the snapshot feature has been implemented. To allow a Vega node to be restarted or join without the need to replay the whole blockchain, a Vega node can load an existing snapshot. Snapshots contain all the network state required to start a node; nodes can use a snapshot stored locally or one created by a different node in the network. Starting a node using a snapshot populates all the state inside the core as if the core had processed the historic blockchain. The node can then start or resume listening to blocks after the snapshot until it gets to the live block height where it will be classed as a normal contributing node. This is a key feature to both ensure the constant availability of the network and for decentralisation.

**On-chain treasury**: This release also sees the introduction of the on-chain treasury. This is a series of, per asset type, accounts that allows the transfer of the reward types that will be seen when trading is enabled. Part of this change has seen the enabling of transfers between wallets, this allows the reward accounts in the treasury to pay out rewards. With these recurring transfers the reward pools will be distributed in full each epoch. This means that the network parameters for fractional payout and payout delays will be removed. Rewards will be distributed to those staking and providing liquidity, first on testnet, and soon it will be available as a feature validators can release on mainnet.

An on-chain treasury, per asset type, has been implemented where the balance of the insurance pool is transferred when the market closes. To enable this transfers between Vega Wallets has been enabled, this not only is a feature of the on-chain treasury/rewards system but also allows people using the protocol to be able to transfer assets between wallets. With this feature there have been other changes around the rewards system meaning the full amount of the global reward pool will be distributed in all assets at the end of each epoch.

**Validators joining and leaving, and standby validators**: 
In addition to the consensus validators, there is now functionality on testnet to allow a set of ersatz, or standby validators. These are validators that will  not contribute to the chain, but are on standby to jump in if a current validator drops off or their performance drops below a certain threshold. In order to be considered as an ersatz validator, the node operators need to meet certain criteria, including a minimum self-stake as well as stake nominated by other token holders.

Note: The network will be set to allow 0 standby validators for alpha mainnet, and increase the validator numbers via governance as early alpha mainnet progresses.

### Versions 0.46.0-0.47.6 combined | 2022-01-11
This release was shared with validators on 11 January, 2022. Validators released it to the mainnet network on 31 January, 2022.

A key theme of this combined release has been improvements to the checkpointing feature; this includes fixes to ensure epochs and other key data is preserved as they should be during checkpoint restarts. In addition to this, the “free-form governance” feature has been implemented. This feature further decentralises the protocol by allowing users to submit a range of governance proposals for community consideration and voting.

The protocol calculates a validator score for each validator. This score is used to set their voting power in Tendermint and determine their reward amounts. The changes introduced in this release mean that the protocol no longer prevents users from delegating to any node, however, an overcrowded node will impact the validator score thus affecting rewards. Further scoring of performance measurements in future releases will bring with it the mechanism to adjust rewards in reflection of validator performance in the network. This is another step in getting the network more decentralised, and open to new validators joining the network.

A “null blockchain” implementation of the protocol has been created. Whilst this has no impact on the validators running the nodes, or users using the network, it’s an important part of our future testing, and validation of the protocol strategy. In fact it’s the first step into building an integrated tool, or suite of tools, in order to simulate networks in various conditions.
