# Propose new futures successor market

Propose a cash-settled futures market to succeed an existing market, taking along the equity-like share and a portion of the insurance pool.

## Requirements

You will need:
* A connected [Vega wallet](../../tools/vega-wallet/index.md), with your wallet name and public key to hand
* A minimum of whichever is larger, associated with that public key: <NetworkParameter frontMatter={frontMatter} param="governance.proposal.market.minProposerBalance" hideValue={true}/>   (<NetworkParameter frontMatter={frontMatter} param="governance.proposal.market.minProposerBalance" hideName={true} formatter="governanceToken" suffix="tokens"/>) or <NetworkParameter frontMatter={frontMatter} param="spam.protection.proposal.min.tokens" hideValue={true}/> (<NetworkParameter frontMatter={frontMatter} param="spam.protection.proposal.min.tokens" hideName={true} formatter="governanceToken"  formatter="governanceToken" suffix="tokens"/>)
* Familiarity with [successor market governance](../../concepts/governance.md#propose-a-successor-market) on Vega

## Anatomy of a new successor market proposal
The new successor market proposal requires the same fields as a new market proposal, with the addition of two fields described below. 

See the [new market proposal tutorial](new-market-proposal.md#anatomy-of-a-market-proposal) for what each field accepts and needs to contain.

* Settlement asset must match that of the parent market.
* Instrument name and code should be different to the parent market.

### Successor market fields
The following `successor` parameters need to be used if you are proposing a market that will succeed an existing market. A successor market that passes governance and is enacted will take the LPs' equity-like share from the parent market, and whatever percentage of the insurance market you choose in the proposal.

* Parent market ID: Required to define the proposal as for a successor market
* Insurance pool fraction: Required percentage of the parent market's insurance pool, up to 100%, can be earmarked for transfer to the successor market. It is submitted as a number between and including 0 and 1, which represents the factor for the percentage.

## Voting
All proposals are voted on by the community. 

Building support is down to you. Share your proposal in the [_Governance_ section ↗](https://community.vega.xyz/c/governance) on the Vega community forum. You may also wish to share on [Discord ↗](https://vega.xyz/discord).

To vote, community members need, at a minimum, the larger of <NetworkParameter frontMatter={frontMatter} param="governance.proposal.market.minVoterBalance" formatter="governanceToken" suffix="tokens" hideName={true} /> or <NetworkParameter frontMatter={frontMatter} formatter="governanceToken" param="spam.protection.voting.min.tokens" suffix="tokens" hideName={true} /> associated to their Vega key.

Your proposal will need [participation](../../concepts/governance.md#how-a-proposals-outcome-is-calculated) of <NetworkParameter frontMatter={frontMatter} param="governance.proposal.market.requiredParticipation" formatter="percent" hideName={true} /> and a majority of <NetworkParameter frontMatter={frontMatter} param="governance.proposal.market.requiredMajority" formatter="percent" hideName={true} />, so having community support is essential.

Proposers who invite feedback, engage with comments, and make revisions to meet the needs of the community are more likely to be successful.

## Enactment
If successful, the proposal will be enacted at the time you specify in the `enactmentTimestamp` field, depending on the [status of other successor market proposals](../../concepts/governance.md#proposal-outcome-successor-market).
