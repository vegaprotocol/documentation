This guide will walk you through how to set up the Vega Wallet from scratch to use when building a Vega dApp, or integrating with CI/CD.

You can find the current working CI/CD implementation in the [front-end GitHub repo ↗](https://github.com/vegaprotocol/frontend-monorepo/blob/develop/.github/actions/setup-vegawallet/action.yml).

Depending on your end-goal, you may be able to skip some steps. API token-related steps are only needed for end-to-end and CI/CD integration. Also, if you already have Vega Wallet prepared and configured, you may only need the last step to run the wallet.

## 1. Create credential files

**Create two files for your `passphrase` and `recovery` phrase** - `passphrase` will be used as a wallet and API token password (you may want to use two different ones), and `recovery` will contain recovery phrase of the wallet you want to use (you can skip it if you don’t have a wallet yet, and want to create a new one).

## 2. Download software

**Download and install the Vega Wallet software.**
There are two ways you can do that:

a. Download the latest release of the [Vega software ↗](https://github.com/vegaprotocol/vega/releases) and unzip it to a shared location. To test if it worked, run the `vega version` command.

b. Clone the [Vega repo ↗](https://github.com/vegaprotocol/vega). Make sure you have installed `go`. Read the guide for [getting started with Go for Vega ↗](https://github.com/vegaprotocol/vega/blob/develop/GETTING_STARTED.md#installing-golang) if you need help. Set up the `GOBIN` environment and add it to `PATH` (e.g. `export GOBIN="$HOME/go/bin; export PATH=$GOBIN/:$PATH`. Run `go install ./…` to install the binaries. Verify by running the command `vega version`.

## 3. Initialise the software

**Initialise the wallet** using the command below to create new, fresh wallet files.

```bash
vega wallet init -f --home <WALLET_PATH>
```

The `--home <WALLET_PATH>` flag sets your wallet location. Skip it in this step, and all following steps, if you want to use default location.

The `-f` flag overwrites any existing wallet configuration at the home location.

## 4. Create or import wallet

**Create a new wallet or import an existing wallet or wallets.** You can create/import as many wallets as you want.

a. To create a new wallet:

```bash
vega wallet create -w <WALLET_NAME> -p passphrase --home  <WALLET_PATH>
```

b. To import the wallet using the recovery phrase:

```bash
vega wallet import -w <WALLET_NAME> --recovery-phrase-file recovery -p passphrase --home <WALLET_PATH>
```

## 5. Add more public keys (optional)

**Create additional public keys** (optional) with the following command:

```bash
vega wallet key generate -w <WALLET_NAME> -p passphrase --home <WALLET_PATH>
```

## 6. Import network configuration

You can import network config in two ways. See more details in the [manage networks guide](../../../tools/vega-wallet/cli-wallet/guides/manage-networks):

a. Using the config URL:

```
vega wallet network import --from-url <CONFIG_URL> -f --home <WALLET_NAME>`.  
```

The `-f` flag overwrites the config if one already exists.

Example: To import `mainnet1` network use: `vega wallet network import --from-url https://github.com/vegaprotocol/networks/blob/master/mainnet1/mainnet1.toml`.

b. Using a file: If you want to import network config for a local Vega Capsule network use the following command:

```bash
vega wallet network import --force --from-file <CONFIG_FILE> --home <WALLET_PATH>
```

## 7. Get a long-lived token (optional)

To connect to the local service with a headless software (bots, scripts, CI/CD systems) you need to obtain a long-living token.

Follow the ["Use long-living tokens" guide](./use-long-living-tokens.md) to know how, if not already done.

## 8. Start the service

Now, to start the service you need:

a. For general purpose use, run the command:

```bash
vega wallet service run -n <NETWORK_NAME> --home <WALLET_PATH>
```

b. For headless software, run the command::

```bash
vega wallet service run -n <NETWORK_NAME> --load-tokens --tokens-passphrase-file passphrase --no-version-check --home <WALLET_PATH>
```

`--load-tokens` allows you to use the API token that you set up in the previous step.
`--no-version-check` allows you to skip network compatibility verification.

## Updating version

Once you set up a wallet for the first time, you will probably only need to run the `service run` command and update the binaries when a new version is released.
