# Welcome! 
Welcome to Vega! 

You are currently on the documenation for Vega's mainnet network. Documentation you see will be for the Vega software version that mainnet is currently running. If you want to see info for Fairground, the Vega-run testnet, switch network in the top bar of this page.

If you have questions, join our community on [Discord](https://vega.xyz/discord)! We're keen to help.

## What is Vega?
Vega is a protocol for creating and trading derivatives on a fully decentralised network. 

The Vega mainnet is run by a set of [validator nodes](./vega-chain/validator-nodes.md). There's also a Vega testnet called Fairground, where it's possible to try trading cash-settled futures and perpetuals on a test network.

## What stage is Vega's mainnet?
The current version of mainnet is the second decentralised phase of the Vega network. The second step of a three-stage launch process, it will be followed by more feature-rich mainnet, pending software development and validators choosing to release it.

## What can you do on the Vega mainnet?

* **Trade on cash-settled futures and perpetuals markets** - Trade on markets proposed and voted in by the community programmatically or by using [Console](https://console.vega.xyz) or another UI.<br/>
* **Tokenholders can nominate validators** - Earn staking rewards for securing the network using the [governance dApp](https://governance.vega.xyz). <br/>
* **Take part in network governance** - Tokenholders can propose and vote on new markets, as well as changes to existing markets and network configuration. <br/>

You'll need a wallet that connects to the Vega network to trade, nominate validators, and take part in governance. See all the options under [apps](../tools/index.md).
