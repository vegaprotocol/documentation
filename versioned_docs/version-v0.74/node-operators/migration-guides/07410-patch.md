title: Patch your node for fix at block 41090347
sidebar_label: v0.74.10 patch
---

On 27 March 2024, the Vega mainnet stopped producing blocks as detailed in [this incident report 竊余(https://blog.vega.xyz/incident-report-network-outage-dd83e48072c8). Nodes had differing `appHash` values because of how price monitoring bounds were sorted, and has been fixed in the following [patch release 竊余(https://github.com/vegaprotocol/vega/releases/tag/v0.74.10-fix.1).

To fix the network, you'll need to update with a new binary that includes the patch fix. You can see the [fix diff on GitHub 竊余(https://github.com/vegaprotocol/vega/compare/v0.74.10...v0.74.10-fix.1).

Steps to fix the issue:

1. Stop your node.
2. Run tm rollback for a single block: `vega tm rollback --home <tendermint_home>`
3. Replace vega binary with [v0.74.10-fix.1 竊余(https://github.com/vegaprotocol/vega/releases/tag/v0.74.10-fix.1)
4. Update config/flag to your node from the one before last snapshot.
- If you use Visor, you can add the following path to the run-config.toml file (`<vegavisor_home>/current/run-config.toml>`): `"--snapshot.load-from-block-height", "41090047"`,
- If you do not use Visor, you can add the following flag to your start command: `--snapshot.load-from-block-height 41090047`
- Or, you can update the core config snapshot height (`<vega_home>/config/node/config.toml`): Snapshot.StartHeight = 41090047
6. Start node
7. When your node is stable and running, revert the change applied in step 4.

:::note Examples
You can find example configs below:

```toml title="vegavisor_home/current/run-config.toml
name = "v0.74.10"

[vega]
  [vega.binary]
    path = "vega"
    args = ["start", "--home", ".../vega_home", "--tendermint-home", "...tendermint_home", "--nodewallet-passphrase-file", ".../vega_home/all-wallet-passphrase.txt", "--snapshot.load-from-block-height", "41090047"]
  [vega.rpc]
    socketPath = "/home/vega/run/vega.sock"
    httpPath = "/rpc"

[data_node]
  [data_node.binary]
    path = "vega"
    args = ["datanode", "start", "--home", "/home/vega/vega_home"]
```

```toml title="vega_home/config/node/config.toml
...
