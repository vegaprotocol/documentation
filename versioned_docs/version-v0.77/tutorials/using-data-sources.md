## Choosing a data source when proposing a market
A market proposal must specify details about the data it requires. When configuring a market's instrument, you will need to select the data source for the following events: settlement and, if applicable, trading termination. 

This is done by:
1. Defining a data source spec binding for settlement price
2. Configuring a data source spec for settlement price values
3. Defining a data source spec binding for trading termination, for dated futures markets
4. Configuring a data source spec for trading termination values, for dated futures markets

The **binding** tells the market which field contains the value. The **spec** defines where this data will come from, and which values to pass through to the binding.

## EVM data sources
Settlement data can be sourced from smart contracts and EVM chains that support Ethereum RPC calls.

Data sources that use Ethereum RPC calls cause the Vega network validators to read the result from the specified smart contract and submit the result to Vega. When the data is verified by enough validators, this price is accepted on to the network.

Read on for examples and guidance on [ABIs](#abi), [normalisers](#normaliser) and [time trigger](#time-trigger).

### Using a Pyth price feed
Vega supports using Pyth price feeds, with data published to Gnosis or other EVM chains.

When considering a market to propose, check the [Pyth price feed IDs ↗](https://pyth.network/developers/price-feed-ids) to determine if Pyth provides the required price data feed.

The following spec would read from the Gnosis contract at `0x71...17b43` to pull data from the Pyth price feed `0xe6...5b43` every 60 seconds, and fetch the Bitcoin price value from the returned object. 

You can use the below snippet for contract and ABI details in your proposal. The ABI is contract-specific and thus won't change.

### Using an Ethereum price feed
The following spec would read from the Ethereum contract at `0x1b4...e43` every 30 seconds, and fetch the Bitcoin price value from the returned object:

```javascript
"dataSourceSpecForSettlementData": {
  "external": {
      "ethOracle": {
        "sourceChainId": "1",
        "address": "0x1b44F3514812d835EB1BDB0acB33d3fA3351Ee43",

        "trigger": {
            "timeTrigger": {

              "numberDecimalPlaces": 8
            },
            "conditions": [{
              "operator": "OPERATOR_GREATER_THAN_OR_EQUAL",
              "value": "0"
            }]
        }]
      }
  }
}
```

### ABI
The `address` field in the specification tells the spec above which address to interact with on the chain. 

The `abi` ([Application Binary Interface ↗](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/develop/abi-spec.html#json) & `method` field on the specs above tell the settlement spec **how** to interact with it. 

EVM oracle settlement specifications use the JSON ABI of the smart contract to describe the method on the contract that will be called to fetch the data. The ABI will contain the function name, details of any parameters required, and the format of the response.

Examples: 

You can see the Pyth data feed ABI on [Gnosisscan ↗](https://gnosisscan.io/address/0x719abd606155442c21b7d561426d42bd0e40a776#readProxyContract). When defining the data source spec, you can populate the `abi` field with the full ABI, and then set the `method` to `getPrice`.

The [Chainlink BTC/USD oracle ↗](https://data.chain.link/ethereum/mainnet/crypto-usd/btc-usd) has its JSON ABI [published on Etherscan ↗](https://etherscan.io/address/0xf4030086522a5beea4988f8ca5b36dbc97bee88c#code). When defining the data source spec, you can populate the `abi` field with the full ABI, and then set the `method` to `latestRoundData`.

:::note Shrinking the ABI
When populating the `abi` field on your data source spec, you can remove the methods and other fields that are not required by the oracle.
:::

### Time trigger
As it says above, with EVM data source specs the validators will read the specified smart contract and method detailed in the ABI. The `trigger` instructs the validators when to do this.

### Normaliser
A [JSONPath](https://datatracker.ietf.org/wg/jsonpath/about/) expression use to extract data from the JSON returned from the method call. In the examples above, `expression` is set to `$[0]`, which returns the first item in an array. `$` would return the complete result.

## Open Oracle signed messages
Vega's data sourcing framework supports signed ABI-encoded [Open Oracle ↗](https://github.com/compound-finance/open-oracle) or JSON messages. ABI-encoded signed messages can be verified to have come from the public key that signed them, which allows markets on Vega to use pricing data sourced from Ethereum.

When it's time for a market to settle, someone needs to submit the data that matches the data source spec defined in the market. Any Vega keypair can submit the data. In the configuration for a market, a data source specification field dictates which data feeds it is interested in. In effect, it works as a filter. This specification means that the creator of an instrument for a market will choose in advance a price source, and which data fields the market requires to settle and optionally terminate.

### Using Open Oracle signed messages in a market proposal
For the binding, use the `name` field of the data. In the case of Open Oracle messages, the price data will be availableas 'prices.currency-code.value', for example:`"prices.BTC.value"`.

For now this will focus on using the data for settlement price - both examples below use a Vega time data source to terminate the market.

```javascript
"dataSourceSpecBinding": {
  "settlementDataProperty": "prices.BTC.value",
  "tradingTerminationProperty": "vegaprotocol.builtin.timestamp"
}
```

The following spec would make the market use the BTC value from the [Coinbase Price Oracle ↗](https://blog.coinbase.com/introducing-the-coinbase-price-oracle-6d1ee22c7068) data that is submitted in a subsequent example:

```javascript
   "dataSourceSpecForSettlementData": {
        "signers": [{"ethAddress": { "address": "0xfCEAdAFab14d46e20144F48824d0C09B1a03F2BC" } }],
        "filters": [{
            "key": {
                "name": "prices.BTC.timestamp",
                "type": "TYPE_INTEGER",
            },
            "conditions": [{
                "operator": "OPERATOR_GREATER_THAN",
                "value": "1649265840",
            }]
        }]
    }
```

The `signers: ethAddress` in this case is the Ethereum public key that **signed the data in the message**. 

### Submitting Open Oracle data
Use the command line to submit an Open Oracle message as a transaction that is signed by your Vega wallet and sent to the validators for consensus.

Below, find instructions on how to submit Open Oracle data as a signed message. Markets should be configured to only use the data at the relevant time, such as after a defined settlement date, in the [market proposal](./proposals/new-market-proposal.md).

When it's time for a market to settle, someone needs to submit the data that matches the data source spec defined in the market.

### 1. Obtain an Open Oracle message

Encoding an item as base64 isn't a one-liner on Windows. There are numerous online sites that can encode a string, or you can use your programming language of choice to do it. To do it locally, save the response to a file, `raw.txt`:

### 3. Submit the message to the chain
When submitting the `OracleDataSubmission`, make sure to specify the `source` field as `ORACLE_SOURCE_OPEN_ORACLE`.

<Tabs groupId="submitOpenOracle">
  <TabItem value="cmd" label="Linux / OSX command line">

```bash
vegawallet transaction send \
    --wallet oracle-wallet \
    --pubkey 123abc \
    --network mainnet1 \
    '{"oracleDataSubmission": { "source": "ORACLE_SOURCE_OPEN_ORACLE", "payload":"INSERT_PAYLOAD_STRING" }}'
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="win" label="Windows command line">

```bash
vegawallet.exe transaction send \
    --wallet oracle-wallet \
    --pubkey 123abc \
    --network mainnet1 \
    '{"oracleDataSubmission": { "source": "ORACLE_SOURCE_OPEN_ORACLE", "payload":"INSERT_PAYLOAD_STRING" }}'
```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>


You will be able to see this data by querying the API for `OracleData`. In the API response you will be able to check which markets had filters that matched this data.

### Querying the data
The [Oracle Data list REST endpoint](../api/rest/data-v2/trading-data-service-list-oracle-data) shows previous data submissions, which can be useful for confirming that data submission was sucessful, and/or determining the fields that a market's data source spec requires.

## JSON signed message data
[JSON ↗](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/JSON) messages are a simpler, more configurable alternative to Open Oracle data. They can be totally custom objects, as long as they are valid JSON. As they are not attested by any off-chain source in the way that Open Oracle messages are, and so it's generally advisable to check for an Open Oracle price source before choosing JSON data. The Vega key that signs the message will be referred to as the source for the data. 

When it's time for a market to settle, someone needs to submit the data that matches the data source spec defined in the market. Any Vega keypair can submit the data. In the configuration for a market, a data source specification field dictates which data feeds it is interested in. In effect, it works as a filter. This specification means that the creator of an instrument for a market will choose in advance a price source, and which data fields the market requires to settle and optionally terminate.

### Using JSON signed message data in a market proposal
For the binding, use the `name` field of the data. In the following example, the market is settled based on the number of people who have walked on the moon.

```javascript
"dataSourceSpecBinding": {
  "settlementDataProperty": "moonwalkers",
  "tradingTerminationProperty": "vegaprotocol.builtin.timestamp"
}
```

The data source specification that would bind to the `moonwalkers` property would be as follows:

```javascript
   "dataSourceSpecForSettlementData": {
        "signers": [{ "pubKey":{ "key": "123abc" }}],
        "filters": [{
            "key": {
                "name": "moonwalkers",
                "type": "TYPE_INTEGER",
                "numberDecimalPlaces": "0"
            },
            "conditions": [{
                "operator": "OPERATOR_GREATER_THAN",
                "value": "12",
            }]
        }]
    }
```

### Submitting JSON data
Use the command line to submit a JSON message as a transaction that is signed by your Vega wallet and sent to the validators for consensus.

:::info API note
- Data should be encoded as strings. `true` should be `"true"`, `12` should be `"12"`
- In the API responses, the `pubKeys` field for JSON oracle data submissions is set to the VEGA public key of the submitter.
:::

### 1. Define your JSON structure
JSON data should be submitted as a single object of attributes and primitive values (i.e. no objects or arrays). Exactly what the attributes are called is up to the submitter of the data. Pick your structure in advance and ensure that it's well communicated. For this tutorial, we'll create a JSON data source for the number of humans that have walked on the moon:

```json
{
  "moonwalkers": "12"
}
```

### 2. Encode the message
All `OracleDataSubmission` data is `base64` encoded. Here's how to do that on Linux or OSX:

Encoding an item as base64 isn't a one-liner on Windows. There are numerous online sites that can encode a string, or you can use your programming language of choice to do it. 

To do it locally, save `'{"moonwalkers":"12"}'` to a file, `raw.txt`. 

Then run the following command: 
```
certutil -encode raw.txt encoded.txt
```

`encoded.txt` now contains your encoded message.

### 3. Submit the message to the chain
When submitting the `OracleDataSubmission`, make sure to specify the `source` field as `ORACLE_SOURCE_JSON`.

    '{"oracleDataSubmission": { "source": "ORACLE_SOURCE_JSON", "payload":"RESPONSE_PAYLOAD" }}'
```

### Querying an existing data source spec
The [Oracle Data list REST endpoint](../api/rest/data-v2/trading-data-service-list-oracle-data) shows previous data submissions, which can be useful for confirming that a data submission was successful, and/or determining the fields that a market's data source spec requires.

## Built-in data source
Vega provides a timestamp source, which is useful for terminating a market at a set date. `vegaprotocol.builtin.timestamp` provides a Unix timestamp of the Vega time, which is to say the time agreed via consensus.

As the name implies, a built in data source is generated inside Vega, and cannot be submitted by other keys.

### Using built-in data for trading termination
It's possible to settle on any data source field - for instance checking if a `boolean` is `true` - but time is a good starting point, and the [built-in time data source](#built-in-data-source) can be used for exactly that. 

When using the built-in time source, **use greater than or equals**, rather than solely equals. This will help to avoid missing the time if no event is emitted with the precise required timestamp.

```javascript
"dataSourceSpecForTradingTermination": {
    // pubKeys is empty as this is using a built in source
    "pubKeys": [],
    "filters": [{
        "key": {
            "name": "vegaprotocol.builtin.timestamp",
            "type": "TYPE_TIMESTAMP",
        },
        "conditions": [{
            "operator": "OPERATOR_GREATER_THAN_OR_EQUAL",
            "value": "1660826549",
        }]
    }]
}
```

This spec would make the market cease trading when the built-in time data source posted a Vega timestamp update that was on or after Thu Mar 31 2022 at 00:00:00.
