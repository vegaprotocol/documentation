# Create a freeform proposal
Freeform proposals allow the community to propose and vote on matters which don't change any of the behaviour of the currently running Vega blockchain.

At enactment time, no changes are effected on the system, but the record of how token holders voted will be stored on chain. 

## Requirements

You will need:
* A connected [Vega wallet](../../tools/vega-wallet/index.md), with your wallet name and public key to hand
* A minimum of whichever is larger, associated with that public key: <NetworkParameter frontMatter={frontMatter} param="governance.proposal.freeform.minProposerBalance" hideValue={true}/> (<NetworkParameter frontMatter={frontMatter} param="governance.proposal.freeform.minProposerBalance" hideName={true} formatter="governanceToken" suffix="tokens"/>) or <NetworkParameter frontMatter={frontMatter} param="spam.protection.proposal.min.tokens" hideValue={true}/> (<NetworkParameter frontMatter={frontMatter} param="spam.protection.proposal.min.tokens" hideName={true} formatter="governanceToken"  formatter="governanceToken" suffix="tokens"/>)
* Familiarity with [governance on Vega](../../concepts/governance/index.md)

<!-- You should also share your proposal idea in the [_Freeform Proposals_ forum section 竊余(https://community.vega.xyz/c/governance/free-form-proposals/31) before submitting it to the network.
-->

## Submitting proposals in a batch
<Batch />

## Templates and submitting

In the tabs below you'll see:

* Annotated example describing what each field is for
* JSON example that can be submitted with the [governance dApp 竊余(https://governance.fairground.wtf/proposals/propose/raw)
* Command line examples for different operating systems

**Replace the example data with the relevant details.**

## Voting
All proposals are voted on by the community. 

<!--
Building support is down to you. Share your proposal in the [_Governance_ section 竊余(https://community.vega.xyz/c/governance) on the Vega community forum. You may also wish to share on [Discord 竊余(https://vega.xyz/discord).
-->

To vote, community members need, at a minimum, the larger of <NetworkParameter frontMatter={frontMatter} param="spam.protection.voting.min.tokens" suffix="tokens" hideName={true} /> or <NetworkParameter frontMatter={frontMatter} param="governance.proposal.freeform.minVoterBalance" suffix="tokens" hideName={true} />, associated to their Vega key. 

Your proposal will need [participation](../../concepts/governance/lifecycle.md#how-a-proposals-outcome-is-calculated) of <NetworkParameter frontMatter={frontMatter} param="governance.proposal.freeform.requiredParticipation" formatter="percent" hideName={true} /> and a voting majority of <NetworkParameter frontMatter={frontMatter} param="governance.proposal.freeform.requiredMajority" formatter="percent" hideName={true} />, so having community support is essential.

Proposers who invite feedback, engage with comments, and make revisions to meet the needs of the community are more likely to be successful.
