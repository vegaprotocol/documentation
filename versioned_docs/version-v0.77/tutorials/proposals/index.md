Markets and assets can only be added through governance, and network parameters, markets and assets all must be amended through governance as well.

## Requirements

You must meet certain criteria before you can submit. Requirements may differ depending on the type of proposal.

You will typically need:

- A connected [Vega wallet](../../tools/vega-wallet/index.md), with your wallet name and public key to hand
- A minimum amount of governance tokens associated with that public key
- Familiarity with [governance concepts](../../concepts/governance/index.md)

## Proposal types

This section includes sample proposals that you can amend and submit via the command line.

Read more about the lifecycle of a governance proposal in [the Concepts section](../../concepts/governance/lifecycle.md).
