Governance with tokenholder participation is essential on Vega. Markets and assets can only be added through governance, and network parameters, markets and assets all must be amended through governance as well.

## Requirements

You must meet certain criteria before you can submit. Requirements may differ depending on the type of proposal.

You will typically need:

- A connected [Vega wallet](../../tools/vega-wallet/index.md), with your wallet name and public key to hand
- A minimum amount of Vega tokens associated with that public key
- Familiarity with [governance on Vega](../../concepts/governance/index.md)

## Proposal types

This section includes sample proposals that you can amend and submit via the command line.

Read more about the lifecycle of a governance proposal in [the Concepts section](../../concepts/governance/lifecycle.md).
