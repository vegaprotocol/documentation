## Vega Wallet
Use **[Vega Wallet](./vega-wallet/index.md)** to connect to a network to trade, associate tokens for staking, and sign messages. Using the Vega Wallet ensures your keys will be completely disassociated from your personal identity, unless you share your public key for any reason.

There are several ways to interact with a Vega Wallet: 
* **[Browser extension (Alpha version)](./vega-wallet/index.md#vega-wallet-browser-extension)**
* **[CLI wallet app](./vega-wallet/cli-wallet/index.md)**

## Trading interface
Use **[Vega Console](https://console.fairground.wtf)** to try trading on a testnet trading interface. The Fairground network is set up to provide a fairly realistic experience where you can try out the Vega software to place orders, provide liquidity, and see how the market mechanics work.

## Vega Tools repo
The **[Vega Tools repo](https://github.com/vegaprotocol/vegatools)** provides a set of utilities for inspecting and interacting with a network through the APIs.
