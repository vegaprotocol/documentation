The Vega Wallet apps allow you to manage wallets and key pairs, deposit and withdraw assets, stake and sign transactions.

You can interact with a Vega wallet and its keys through a browser extension, two different apps, or integrate using the API.

## Browser extension
The Vega Wallet browser extension is an early stage implementation of the Vega Wallet, available for Chrome and Firefox.

**[Chrome extension ↗](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/vega-wallet/codfcglpplgmmlokgilfkpcjnmkbfiel)**

**[Firefox extension ↗](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-GB/firefox/addon/vega-wallet-beta/)**

The browser extension lets you connect to a Vega Wallet right in your browser, rather than having to install a separate app. It allows you to:
* Create a new wallet and public keys
* Import an existing wallet and its keys
* Approve or reject transactions


## CLI app
Use the **[command line app](./cli-wallet/index.md)** to do everything you can do with the desktop app, plus:
* Customise key details 
* Isolate keys
* Build and send transactions

## Wallet API
Integrate with the [Vega Wallet API](../category/api/wallet-api) to build UIs or create other headless applications like bots or scripts.
