An auction duration is used to configure 3 auction periods:
1. `duration &#x003E; 0`, `volume == 0`:
The auction will last for at least N seconds.
2. `duration == 0`, `volume &#x003E; 0`:
The auction will end once we can close with given traded volume.
3. `duration &#x003E; 0`, `volume &#x003E; 0`:
The auction will take at least N seconds, but can end sooner if we can trade a certain volume.

```graphql
type AuctionDuration {
  durationSecs: Int!
  volume: Int!
}
```
