MetaMask Snaps lets you quickly set up a Vega keypair for trading, staking tokens, and sending other transactions. No Vega Wallet software required.

## Set up your snap for Vega
Once you have MetaMask installed, the easiest way to set up a snap is by using [Vega Console ↗](https://console.vega.xyz) or the Vega [governance dApp ↗](https://governance.vega.xyz).

When you start using MetaMask Snaps, you'll be creating a new Vega key, so if you have assets or VEGA tokens on an existing key, you'll need to transfer them to the new key to use them.

1. Open the `Connect` dialog in Vega Console or the governance dApp. 
2. If you have a version of MetaMask that supports Snaps, you'll see a button labelled `Install Vega MetaMask Snap`.
3. MetaMask will open a Connection request pop-up. Click `Connect`.
4. `Install` Snaps using the MetaMask pop-up.
5. `Confirm` that you want Vega Protocol to control your account.
6. Use the Vega dApp `Connect` dialog to `Connect via MetaMask Snap`

You're now readyto deposit or transfer assets and use your new Vega keypair.

## Snaps features
What can you do with a snap? If you're already a MetaMask user, you won't need to create a Vega Wallet.

The snap lets you:
- Derive Vega cryptographic keys that can be used on the Vega network
- Receive in-depth information of transactions you've initiated in the Vega dApp 
- Approve transactions that will then be signed and sent to the network, or reject them
- Automatically connect to the Vega network you're using

## Limitations
A snap cannot:
- Connect to an existing Vega Wallet or keypair, you'll need to start with a new keypair
- Cannot show your Vega assets or their balances in MetaMask
  - To see your balances, rewards, or deposit, withdraw or transfer assets between keys, you'll need to interact with Console or the governance dApp
- Rename, import, or export keys
- Show a list of previous transactions

## Troubleshooting

### Can't see assets I've previously deposited
If this is your first time using Snap with Vega, but you have previously deposited assets on a different Vega key, you'll need to transfer your assets to the new keys created by your Snap instance, or deposit new assets. You can copy your Vega snap public key from within Vega Console.

### How do I recover my Vega keys?
The Vega keys created with snap are derived from the MetaMask seed. You'll need to use your MetaMask recovery phrase to recover those Vega keys, and any assets added to them.
