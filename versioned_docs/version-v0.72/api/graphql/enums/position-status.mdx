Position status can change if a position is distressed

```graphql
enum PositionStatus {
  POSITION_STATUS_UNSPECIFIED
  POSITION_STATUS_ORDERS_CLOSED
  POSITION_STATUS_CLOSED_OUT
  POSITION_STATUS_DISTRESSED
}
```


### Values

#### [<code style={{ fontWeight: 'normal' }}>PositionStatus.<b>POSITION_STATUS_UNSPECIFIED</b></code>](#) 
> The position is either healthy, or if closed out, was closed out normally
> 

#### [<code style={{ fontWeight: 'normal' }}>PositionStatus.<b>POSITION_STATUS_ORDERS_CLOSED</b></code>](#) 
> The position was distressed, but removing open orders from the book brought the margin level back to a point where the open position could be maintained
> 

#### [<code style={{ fontWeight: 'normal' }}>PositionStatus.<b>POSITION_STATUS_CLOSED_OUT</b></code>](#) 
> The position was distressed, and had to be closed out entirely - orders were removed from the book, and the open volume was closed out by the network
> 

#### [<code style={{ fontWeight: 'normal' }}>PositionStatus.<b>POSITION_STATUS_DISTRESSED</b></code>](#) 
> The position was distressed, but could not be closed out - orders were removed from the book, and the open volume will be closed out once there is sufficient volume on the book
>
