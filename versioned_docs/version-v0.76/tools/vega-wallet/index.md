A Vega Wallet is essential for interacting with Vega, whether it's for staking or trading. The Vega Wallet apps allow you to manage wallets and key pairs, deposit and withdraw assets, stake and sign transactions.

You can interact with a Vega wallet and its keys through a browser extension, two different apps, or integrate using the API.

## Browser extension
The Vega Wallet browser extension is an early stage implementation of the Vega Wallet, available for Chrome and Firefox.

**[Chrome extension ↗](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/vega-wallet-mainnet/codfcglpplgmmlokgilfkpcjnmkbfiel)**

**[Firefox extension ↗](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-GB/firefox/addon/vega-wallet-beta/)**

The browser extension lets you connect to a Vega Wallet right in your browser, rather than having to install a separate app. It allows you to:
* Create a new wallet and public keys
* Import an existing wallet and its keys
* Connect to Vega dApps, such as Console and the governance dApp
* Approve or reject transactions

## Desktop app
The **[desktop wallet](./desktop-app/index.md)** provides a visual interface to: 
* Connect to existing Vega wallet
* Create new wallet 
* Connect to networks
* Sign transactions
* Run and connect to Vega apps, such as Console and the governance dApp

## CLI app
Use the **[command line app](./cli-wallet/index.md)** to do everything you can do with the desktop app, plus:
* Customise key details 
* Isolate keys
* Build and send transactions

## Wallet API
Integrate with the [Vega Wallet API](../category/api/wallet-api) to build UIs or create other headless applications like bots or scripts.
