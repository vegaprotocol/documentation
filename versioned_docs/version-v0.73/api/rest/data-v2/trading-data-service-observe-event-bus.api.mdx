Example:\n\n    package google.profile;\n    message Person {\n      string first_name = 1;\n      string last_name = 2;\n    }\n\n    {\n      \"@type\": \"type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person\",\n      \"firstName\": <string>,\n      \"lastName\": <string>\n    }\n\nIf the embedded message type is well-known and has a custom JSON\nrepresentation, that representation will be embedded adding a field\n`value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the `@type`\nfield. Example (for message [google.protobuf.Duration][]):\n\n    {\n      \"@type\": \"type.googleapis.com/google.protobuf.Duration\",\n      \"value\": \"1.212s\"\n    }","properties":{"@type":{"description":"A URL/resource name that uniquely identifies the type of the serialized\nprotocol buffer message.

The name should be in a canonical form\n(e.g., leading \".\" is not accepted).\n\nIn practice, teams usually precompile into the binary all types that they\nexpect it to use in the context of Any. However, for URLs which use the\nscheme `http`, `https`, or no scheme, one can optionally set up a type\nserver that maps type URLs to message definitions as follows:\n\n* If no scheme is provided, `https` is assumed.\n* An HTTP GET on the URL must yield a [google.protobuf.Type][]\n  value in binary format, or produce an error.\n* Applications are allowed to cache lookup results based on the\n  URL, or have them precompiled into a binary to avoid any\n  lookup. Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be preserved\n  on changes to types. (Use versioned type names to manage\n  breaking changes.)\n\nNote: this functionality is not currently available in the official\nprotobuf release, and it is not used for type URLs beginning with\ntype.googleapis.com.\n\nSchemes other than `http`, `https` (or the empty scheme) might be\nused with implementation specific semantics.","type":"string"}},"type":"object","title":"protobufAny"},"type":"array"},"message":{"type":"string"}},"type":"object","title":"googlerpcStatus"},"result":{"properties":{"events":{"description":"List of events that occurred on the Vega event bus.","items":{"properties":{"account":{"title":"Account events","properties":{"asset":{"description":"Asset ID for the account.","type":"string"},"balance":{"description":"Balance of the asset, the balance is an integer, for example `123456` is a correctly\nformatted price of `1.23456` assuming market configured to 5 decimal places\nand importantly balances cannot be negative.","type":"string"},"id":{"description":"Unique account ID, used internally by Vega.","type":"string"},"marketId":{"description":"Market ID for the account, if `AccountType.ACCOUNT_TYPE_GENERAL` this will be empty.","type":"string"},"owner":{"description":"Party that the account belongs to, special values include `network`, which represents the Vega network and is\nmost commonly seen during liquidation of distressed trading positions.","type":"string"},"type":{"description":"Account type related to this account.","default":"ACCOUNT_TYPE_UNSPECIFIED","enum":["ACCOUNT_TYPE_UNSPECIFIED","ACCOUNT_TYPE_INSURANCE","ACCOUNT_TYPE_SETTLEMENT","ACCOUNT_TYPE_MARGIN","ACCOUNT_TYPE_GENERAL","ACCOUNT_TYPE_FEES_INFRASTRUCTURE","ACCOUNT_TYPE_FEES_LIQUIDITY","ACCOUNT_TYPE_FEES_MAKER","ACCOUNT_TYPE_BOND","ACCOUNT_TYPE_EXTERNAL","ACCOUNT_TYPE_GLOBAL_INSURANCE","ACCOUNT_TYPE_GLOBAL_REWARD","ACCOUNT_TYPE_PENDING_TRANSFERS","ACCOUNT_TYPE_REWARD_MAKER_PAID_FEES","ACCOUNT_TYPE_REWARD_MAKER_RECEIVED_FEES","ACCOUNT_TYPE_REWARD_LP_RECEIVED_FEES","ACCOUNT_TYPE_REWARD_MARKET_PROPOSERS","ACCOUNT_TYPE_HOLDING","ACCOUNT_TYPE_LP_LIQUIDITY_FEES","ACCOUNT_TYPE_LIQUIDITY_FEES_BONUS_DISTRIBUTION","ACCOUNT_TYPE_NETWORK_TREASURY","ACCOUNT_TYPE_VESTING_REWARDS","ACCOUNT_TYPE_VESTED_REWARDS","ACCOUNT_TYPE_REWARD_AVERAGE_POSITION","ACCOUNT_TYPE_REWARD_RELATIVE_RETURN","ACCOUNT_TYPE_REWARD_RETURN_VOLATILITY","ACCOUNT_TYPE_REWARD_VALIDATOR_RANKING","ACCOUNT_TYPE_PENDING_FEE_REFERRAL_REWARD"],"title":"Various collateral/account types as used by Vega","type":"string"}},"type":"object"},"asset":{"title":"Asset events","properties":{"details":{"description":"Definition of the external source for this asset.","properties":{"builtinAsset":{"description":"Vega built-in asset.","properties":{"maxFaucetAmountMint":{"description":"Maximum amount that can be requested by a party through the built-in asset faucet at a time.","type":"string"}},"title":"Vega internal asset","type":"object"},"decimals":{"description":"Number of decimal / precision handled by this asset.","format":"uint64","type":"string"},"erc20":{"description":"Ethereum ERC20 asset.","properties":{"contractAddress":{"description":"Address of the contract for the token, on the ethereum network.","type":"string"},"lifetimeLimit":{"description":"Lifetime limits deposit per address\nnote: this is a temporary measure that can be changed by governance.","type":"string"},"withdrawThreshold":{"description":"Maximum you can withdraw instantly.

Example:\n\n    package google.profile;\n    message Person {\n      string first_name = 1;\n      string last_name = 2;\n    }\n\n    {\n      \"@type\": \"type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person\",\n      \"firstName\": <string>,\n      \"lastName\": <string>\n    }\n\nIf the embedded message type is well-known and has a custom JSON\nrepresentation, that representation will be embedded adding a field\n`value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the `@type`\nfield. Example (for message [google.protobuf.Duration][]):\n\n    {\n      \"@type\": \"type.googleapis.com/google.protobuf.Duration\",\n      \"value\": \"1.212s\"\n    }","properties":{"@type":{"description":"A URL/resource name that uniquely identifies the type of the serialized\nprotocol buffer message.

Example (for message [google.protobuf.Duration][]):\n\n    {\n      \"@type\": \"type.googleapis.com/google.protobuf.Duration\",\n      \"value\": \"1.212s\"\n    }","properties":{"@type":{"description":"A URL/resource name that uniquely identifies the type of the serialized\nprotocol buffer message.

Distressed positions event contains the party IDs for all parties that were distressed, had their orders closed but because of insufficient volume on the book
could not be fully closed out. These parties are distressed, but still hold an active position on the book as a result. Once enough volume is on the book to close
them out, a SettleDistressed event will be sent. In case they manage to reduce their position, or meet the margin requirements, this status will be updated.

for expressing where in the contract call result the required data is
located, for example $[0] indicates the first result. $[1].price would look
in the second result returned from the contract for a structure with a key
called 'price' and use that if it exists.

Normalisers are used to convert the data returned from the contract method
into a standard format. The key of the map is the name of the property,
which identifies the specific piece of data to other parts of the data
sourcing framework, for example filters. The value is a JSONPath expression
for expressing where in the contract call result the required data is
located, for example $[0] indicates the first result. $[1].price would look
in the second result returned from the contract for a structure with a key
called 'price' and use that if it exists.

which identifies the specific piece of data to other parts of the data
sourcing framework, for example filters. The value is a JSONPath expression
for expressing where in the contract call result the required data is
located, for example $[0] indicates the first result. $[1].price would look
in the second result returned from the contract for a structure with a key
called 'price' and use that if it exists.

sourcing framework, for example filters. The value is a JSONPath expression
for expressing where in the contract call result the required data is
located, for example $[0] indicates the first result. $[1].price would look
in the second result returned from the contract for a structure with a key
called 'price' and use that if it exists.

Normalisers are used to convert the data returned from the contract method
into a standard format. The key of the map is the name of the property,
which identifies the specific piece of data to other parts of the data
sourcing framework, for example filters. The value is a JSONPath expression
for expressing where in the contract call result the required data is
located, for example $[0] indicates the first result. $[1].price would look
in the second result returned from the contract for a structure with a key
called 'price' and use that if it exists.

into a standard format. The key of the map is the name of the property,
which identifies the specific piece of data to other parts of the data
sourcing framework, for example filters. The value is a JSONPath expression
for expressing where in the contract call result the required data is
located, for example $[0] indicates the first result. $[1].price would look
in the second result returned from the contract for a structure with a key
called 'price' and use that if it exists.

Normalisers are used to convert the data returned from the contract method
into a standard format. The key of the map is the name of the property,
which identifies the specific piece of data to other parts of the data
sourcing framework, for example filters. The value is a JSONPath expression
for expressing where in the contract call result the required data is
located, for example $[0] indicates the first result. $[1].price would look
in the second result returned from the contract for a structure with a key
called 'price' and use that if it exists.

sourcing framework, for example filters. The value is a JSONPath expression
for expressing where in the contract call result the required data is
located, for example $[0] indicates the first result. $[1].price would look
in the second result returned from the contract for a structure with a key
called 'price' and use that if it exists.

Normalisers are used to convert the data returned from the contract method
into a standard format. The key of the map is the name of the property,
which identifies the specific piece of data to other parts of the data
sourcing framework, for example filters. The value is a JSONPath expression
for expressing where in the contract call result the required data is
located, for example $[0] indicates the first result. $[1].price would look
in the second result returned from the contract for a structure with a key
called 'price' and use that if it exists.

sourcing framework, for example filters. The value is a JSONPath expression
for expressing where in the contract call result the required data is
located, for example $[0] indicates the first result. $[1].price would look
in the second result returned from the contract for a structure with a key
called 'price' and use that if it exists.

Normalisers are used to convert the data returned from the contract method
into a standard format. The key of the map is the name of the property,
which identifies the specific piece of data to other parts of the data
sourcing framework, for example filters. The value is a JSONPath expression
for expressing where in the contract call result the required data is
located, for example $[0] indicates the first result. $[1].price would look
in the second result returned from the contract for a structure with a key
called 'price' and use that if it exists.

sourcing framework, for example filters. The value is a JSONPath expression
for expressing where in the contract call result the required data is
located, for example $[0] indicates the first result. $[1].price would look
in the second result returned from the contract for a structure with a key
called 'price' and use that if it exists.

Normalisers are used to convert the data returned from the contract method
into a standard format. The key of the map is the name of the property,
which identifies the specific piece of data to other parts of the data
sourcing framework, for example filters. The value is a JSONPath expression
for expressing where in the contract call result the required data is
located, for example $[0] indicates the first result. $[1].price would look
in the second result returned from the contract for a structure with a key
called 'price' and use that if it exists.

sourcing framework, for example filters. The value is a JSONPath expression
for expressing where in the contract call result the required data is
located, for example $[0] indicates the first result. $[1].price would look
in the second result returned from the contract for a structure with a key
called 'price' and use that if it exists.

Normalisers are used to convert the data returned from the contract method
into a standard format. The key of the map is the name of the property,
which identifies the specific piece of data to other parts of the data
sourcing framework, for example filters. The value is a JSONPath expression
for expressing where in the contract call result the required data is
located, for example $[0] indicates the first result. $[1].price would look
in the second result returned from the contract for a structure with a key
called 'price' and use that if it exists.

sourcing framework, for example filters. The value is a JSONPath expression
for expressing where in the contract call result the required data is
located, for example $[0] indicates the first result. $[1].price would look
in the second result returned from the contract for a structure with a key
called 'price' and use that if it exists.

Normalisers are used to convert the data returned from the contract method
into a standard format. The key of the map is the name of the property,
which identifies the specific piece of data to other parts of the data
sourcing framework, for example filters. The value is a JSONPath expression
for expressing where in the contract call result the required data is
located, for example $[0] indicates the first result. $[1].price would look
in the second result returned from the contract for a structure with a key
called 'price' and use that if it exists.

sourcing framework, for example filters. The value is a JSONPath expression
for expressing where in the contract call result the required data is
located, for example $[0] indicates the first result. $[1].price would look
in the second result returned from the contract for a structure with a key
called 'price' and use that if it exists.

Normalisers are used to convert the data returned from the contract method
into a standard format. The key of the map is the name of the property,
which identifies the specific piece of data to other parts of the data
sourcing framework, for example filters. The value is a JSONPath expression
for expressing where in the contract call result the required data is
located, for example $[0] indicates the first result. $[1].price would look
in the second result returned from the contract for a structure with a key
called 'price' and use that if it exists.

sourcing framework, for example filters. The value is a JSONPath expression
for expressing where in the contract call result the required data is
located, for example $[0] indicates the first result. $[1].price would look
in the second result returned from the contract for a structure with a key
called 'price' and use that if it exists.

Normalisers are used to convert the data returned from the contract method
into a standard format. The key of the map is the name of the property,
which identifies the specific piece of data to other parts of the data
sourcing framework, for example filters. The value is a JSONPath expression
for expressing where in the contract call result the required data is
located, for example $[0] indicates the first result. $[1].price would look
in the second result returned from the contract for a structure with a key
called 'price' and use that if it exists.

for expressing where in the contract call result the required data is
located, for example $[0] indicates the first result. $[1].price would look
in the second result returned from the contract for a structure with a key
called 'price' and use that if it exists.
