## Estimate position



Estimate the margin that would be required for maintaining the specified position. Margin estimates are scaled to asset decimal places.
If the optional collateral available argument is supplied, the response also contains the estimate of the liquidation price.
Liquidation price estimates are scaled to asset decimal places by default, unless an argument to scale to market decimal places is specified in the request.
