However, for URLs which use the\nscheme `http`, `https`, or no scheme, one can optionally set up a type\nserver that maps type URLs to message definitions as follows:\n\n* If no scheme is provided, `https` is assumed.\n* An HTTP GET on the URL must yield a [google.protobuf.Type][]\n  value in binary format, or produce an error.\n* Applications are allowed to cache lookup results based on the\n  URL, or have them precompiled into a binary to avoid any\n  lookup. Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be preserved\n  on changes to types. (Use versioned type names to manage\n  breaking changes.)\n\nNote: this functionality is not currently available in the official\nprotobuf release, and it is not used for type URLs beginning with\ntype.googleapis.com.\n\nSchemes other than `http`, `https` (or the empty scheme) might be\nused with implementation specific semantics.","type":"string"}}></SchemaItem><li><div style={{"fontSize":"var(--ifm-code-font-size)","opacity":"0.6","marginLeft":"-.5rem"}}>]</div></li></div></details></SchemaItem><SchemaItem collapsible={false} name={"message"} required={false} schemaName={"string"} qualifierMessage={undefined} schema={{"type":"string"}}></SchemaItem></ul></details></TabItem><TabItem label={"Example (from schema)"} value={"Example (from schema)"}><ResponseSamples responseExample={"{\n  \"code\": 0,\n  \"details\": [\n    {\n      \"@type\": \"string\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"message\": \"string\"\n}"} language={"json"}></ResponseSamples></TabItem></SchemaTabs></TabItem></MimeTabs></div></TabItem></ApiTabs></div>
