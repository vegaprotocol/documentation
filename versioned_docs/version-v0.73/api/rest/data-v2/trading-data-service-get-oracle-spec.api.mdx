Normalisers are used to convert the data returned from the contract method
into a standard format. The key of the map is the name of the property,
which identifies the specific piece of data to other parts of the data
sourcing framework, for example filters. The value is a JSONPath expression
for expressing where in the contract call result the required data is
located, for example $[0] indicates the first result. $[1].price would look
in the second result returned from the contract for a structure with a key
called 'price' and use that if it exists.
