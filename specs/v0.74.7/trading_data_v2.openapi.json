Example:\n\n    package google.profile;\n    message Person {\n      string first_name = 1;\n      string last_name = 2;\n    }\n\n    {\n      \"@type\": \"type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person\",\n      \"firstName\": <string>,\n      \"lastName\": <string>\n    }\n\nIf the embedded message type is well-known and has a custom JSON\nrepresentation, that representation will be embedded adding a field\n`value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the `@type`\nfield. Example (for message [google.protobuf.Duration][]):\n\n    {\n      \"@type\": \"type.googleapis.com/google.protobuf.Duration\",\n      \"value\": \"1.212s\"\n    }","properties":{"@type":{"description":"A URL/resource name that uniquely identifies the type of the serialized\nprotocol buffer message.

Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be preserved\n  on changes to types. (Use versioned type names to manage\n  breaking changes.)\n\nNote: this functionality is not currently available in the official\nprotobuf release, and it is not used for type URLs beginning with\ntype.googleapis.com.\n\nSchemes other than `http`, `https` (or the empty scheme) might be\nused with implementation specific semantics.","type":"string"}},"type":"object"},"protobufNullValue":{"default":"NULL_VALUE","description":"`NullValue` is a singleton enumeration to represent the null value for the\n`Value` type union.\n\n The JSON representation for `NullValue` is JSON `null`.\n\n - NULL_VALUE: Null value.","enum":["NULL_VALUE"],"type":"string"},"v1AnnounceNode":{"description":"A command that allows a new node operator to announce themselves to the network as a new validator.","properties":{"avatarUrl":{"description":"URL to the node operator's avatar.","type":"string"},"chainPubKey":{"description":"Public key for the blockchain, currently the node's CometBFT key.","type":"string"},"country":{"description":"Country code (ISO 3166-1 alpha-2) for the location of the node.","type":"string"},"ethereumAddress":{"description":"Ethereum public key of the node being announced.","type":"string"},"ethereumSignature":{"$ref":"#/components/schemas/v1Signature","description":"Signature from the node made using the ethereum wallet."},"fromEpoch":{"description":"Epoch from which the node is expected to be ready to validate blocks.","format":"uint64","type":"string"},"id":{"description":"Node ID of the validator, which is the node's public master key.","type":"string"},"infoUrl":{"description":"URL to the node operators homepage allowing stake holders to make an informed decision when delegating.","type":"string"},"name":{"description":"Human-readable name of the node.","type":"string"},"submitterAddress":{"description":"Ethereum public key to use as a submitter to allow automatic signature generation.","type":"string"},"vegaPubKey":{"description":"Vega public key of the node being announced.","type":"string"},"vegaPubKeyIndex":{"description":"Vega public key derivation index.","format":"int64","type":"integer"},"vegaSignature":{"$ref":"#/components/schemas/v1Signature","description":"Signature from the node made using the Vega wallet."}},"type":"object"},"v1ApplyReferralCode":{"description":"Command that allows the submitter to join a referral set and earn a collective reduction in fees based on the activity of all members of that set.\nA party that joins a referral set is called a referee.
