Example:\n\n    package google.profile;\n    message Person {\n      string first_name = 1;\n      string last_name = 2;\n    }\n\n    {\n      \"@type\": \"type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person\",\n      \"firstName\": <string>,\n      \"lastName\": <string>\n    }\n\nIf the embedded message type is well-known and has a custom JSON\nrepresentation, that representation will be embedded adding a field\n`value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the `@type`\nfield. Example (for message [google.protobuf.Duration][]):\n\n    {\n      \"@type\": \"type.googleapis.com/google.protobuf.Duration\",\n      \"value\": \"1.212s\"\n    }","properties":{"@type":{"description":"A URL/resource name that uniquely identifies the type of the serialized\nprotocol buffer message.

Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be preserved\n  on changes to types. (Use versioned type names to manage\n  breaking changes.)\n\nNote: this functionality is not currently available in the official\nprotobuf release, and it is not used for type URLs beginning with\ntype.googleapis.com.\n\nSchemes other than `http`, `https` (or the empty scheme) might be\nused with implementation specific semantics.","type":"string"}},"type":"object"},"protobufNullValue":{"default":"NULL_VALUE","description":"`NullValue` is a singleton enumeration to represent the null value for the\n`Value` type union.\n\n The JSON representation for `NullValue` is JSON `null`.\n\n - NULL_VALUE: Null value.","enum":["NULL_VALUE"],"type":"string"},"v1AnnounceNode":{"properties":{"avatarUrl":{"description":"AvatarURL of the validator.","type":"string"},"chainPubKey":{"description":"Public key for the blockchain, required field.","type":"string"},"country":{"description":"Country code (ISO 3166-1 alpha-2) for the location of the node.","type":"string"},"ethereumAddress":{"description":"Ethereum public key, required field.","type":"string"},"ethereumSignature":{"$ref":"#/components/schemas/v1Signature","description":"Signature from the validator made using the ethereum wallet."},"fromEpoch":{"description":"Epoch from which the validator is expected\nto be ready to validate blocks.","format":"uint64","type":"string"},"id":{"description":"Node ID of the validator, i.e. the node's public master key.","type":"string"},"infoUrl":{"description":"URL with more info on the node.","type":"string"},"name":{"description":"Name of the validator.","type":"string"},"submitterAddress":{"description":"Ethereum public key to use as a submitter to allow automatic signature generation.","type":"string"},"vegaPubKey":{"description":"Vega public key, required field.","type":"string"},"vegaPubKeyIndex":{"description":"Vega public key derivation index.","format":"int64","type":"integer"},"vegaSignature":{"$ref":"#/components/schemas/v1Signature","description":"Signature from the validator made using the Vega wallet."}},"title":"Used to announce a node as a new pending validator","type":"object"},"v1ApplyReferralCode":{"description":"A party that joins a referral team is called a referee.
