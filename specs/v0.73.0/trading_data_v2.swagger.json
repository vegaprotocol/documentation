By default\nsegments contain 1000 blocks. In that case ranges such as (1, 1000), (1001, 2000), (1, 3000)\nwould all fall on segment boundaries and be valid.\n\nThe generated CSV file is compressed into a ZIP file and returned, with the file name\nin the following format: `[chain id]-[table name]-[start block]-[end block].zip`\n\nIn gRPC, results are returned in a chunked stream of base64 encoded data.\n\nThrough the REST gateway, the base64 data chunks are decoded and streamed as a\n`content-type: application/zip` HTTP response.\n\nThe CSV exported data uses a comma as a DELIMITER between fields, and \" for QUOTE-ing fields.\n\nIf a value contains any of: DELIMITER, QUOTE, carriage return, or line feed then the whole\nvalue is prefixed and suffixed by the QUOTE character and any occurrence within\nthe value of a QUOTE character preceded by another QUOTE.\n\nA NULL is output as the NULL parameter string and is not quoted, while a non-NULL value\nmatching the NULL parameter string is quoted.\n\nFor example, with the default settings, a NULL is written as an unquoted empty string,\nwhile an empty string data value is written with double quotes.\n\nNote that CSV files produced may contain quoted values containing embedded carriage returns and line feeds.\nThus the files are not strictly one line per table row like text-format files.\n\nThe first row of the CSV file is a header that describes the contents of each column\nin subsequent rows.\n\nUsually the ZIP file will contain only a single CSV file. However it is possible that\nthe (from_block, to_block) request spans over a range of blocks in which the underlying\nschema of the database changes. For example, a column may have been added, removed, or renamed.\n\nIf this happens, the CSV file will be split at the point of the schema change and the zip\nfile will contain multiple CSV files, with a potentially different set of headers. The\n'version' number of the database schema is part of the in the CSV filename:\n\n `[chain id]-[table name]-[schema version]-[start block]-[end block].zip`\n\nFor example, a zip file might be called mainnet-sometable-000001-003000.zip\n\nAnd contain two CSV files: `mainnet-sometable-1-000001-002000.csv`:\n\ntimestamp, value\n1, foo\n2, bar\n\nAnd `mainnet-sometable-2-002001-003000.csv`:\n\ntimestamp, value, extra_value\n3, baz, apple\n\nIt is worth noting that the schema will not change within a single network history segment.\nbuf:lint:ignore RPC_RESPONSE_STANDARD_NAME\nbuf:lint:ignore RPC_REQUEST_RESPONSE_UNIQUE",

Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be preserved\n  on changes to types.

The default page size is 1000.\n\nTo retrieve subsequent pages, the caller must examine the PageInfo structure\nreturned in the response to find a cursor string that uniquely identifies the\nlast row of that page. This cursor should then be passed in the 'after' field\nof the Pagination message in a subsequent request.\n\nFor paging backward, take the cursor for the first row of the page from PageInfo\nand pass it in the 'before' field of the Pagination message.\n\nPagination message that uses both first/after and last/before is considered invalid."
