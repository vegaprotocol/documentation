Note: Files in this repository are committed automatically on tag. Due to an issue with the process that creates
those files, the ones in ./data/v0.xx are used instead. This is true for:

- v0.52 (No longer built)
- v0.53
- v0.54
- v0.55

As these scripts are used in the build.sh and other scripts, this is only really important to know when shifting
version number in the docs.
